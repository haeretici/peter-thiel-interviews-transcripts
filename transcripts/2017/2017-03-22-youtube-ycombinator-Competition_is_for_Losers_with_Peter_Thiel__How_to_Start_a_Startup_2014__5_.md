[Competition is for Losers with Peter Thiel (How to Start a Startup 2014: 5)](https://youtu.be/3Fx5Q8xGU8k)

[00:00:00] all right good afternoon uh today's speaker

[00:00:03] is Peter teal Peter was the founder of PayPal

[00:00:07] and paler and Founders fund and has invested in uh

[00:00:11] most of the tech companies in in silica Valley and he's going to talk about

[00:00:14] strategy and competition thank you for coming Peter awesome thanks

[00:00:18] uh Sam thanks for inviting me thanks for for having me

[00:00:22] uh I I sort of have a I have a single

[00:00:25] eay FS that I'm completely obsessed with in um

[00:00:29] on on the business side which is that uh if you're starting a company

[00:00:33] if you're the founder entrepreneur starting a company you always want to aim

[00:00:37] for Monopoly and um and that uh

[00:00:40] and you want to always avoid competition and so uh

[00:00:44] hence uh competition is for losers uh something we'll be talking about

[00:00:49] today I'd like to um I'd like to

[00:00:53] start by saying something about um

[00:00:57] the the basic idea of uh when you start one the companies

[00:01:01] um how you go about uh creating value and there's this question

[00:01:04] what makes a business valuable and I want I want to suggest that there's basically

[00:01:08] a very simple uh very simple formula that um

[00:01:13] um you you have a valuable company if two things are true

[00:01:17] uh number one that it creates X dollars of value

[00:01:20] for the world and number two that you capture

[00:01:24] y% of X and and the critical

[00:01:27] thing that uh that I think people always miss in the sort

[00:01:31] of analysis is that X and Y are completely independent

[00:01:35] variables and so um X can be very Big

[00:01:39] Y can be very small X can be of intermediate size

[00:01:43] and if Y is reasonably big you can still get a very big

[00:01:47] business so to create a valuable company you have to basically

[00:01:50] uh both create something of value and capture some fraction of the value

[00:01:55] of what you've created and sort of just to

[00:01:58] just to illustrate this as a as a contrast um

[00:02:03] there's if you sort of compare the US airline

[00:02:06] industry with a company like Google on search

[00:02:11] um if you sort of measure by the size of these industries

[00:02:14] you could you could say that airlines are still more important than search

[00:02:18] if you just measure it say by revenues there's 195 billion

[00:02:22] in uh domestic revenues in 201 uh 2012

[00:02:26] Google had uh just north of 50 billion um and and so

[00:02:30] and certainly sort of on some intuitive level if you said uh

[00:02:34] if you were given a choice and said well do you want to get rid of a all air travel

[00:02:38] or do you want to get rid of your ability to use search engines the intuition would be that

[00:02:41] air travel is something that's more important than search and this is of course just the domestic

[00:02:45] numbers if you looked at this globally um airlines are

[00:02:49] much much bigger than um than uh than than than

[00:02:52] than search or than Google is but uh but the profit margins are

[00:02:56] quite a bit less uh you know they were marginally profitable in 2012 12

[00:03:00] uh I think the entire 100-year history of the airline industry the cumulative

[00:03:04] profits in the US have been approximately zero know companies make money

[00:03:08] they episodically go bankrupt they get recapitalized and you sort of cycle

[00:03:11] and and repeat and this is reflected in you know the the

[00:03:15] combined market capitalization of the of the airline Industries maybe

[00:03:19] uh something um of the US airline industry something like

[00:03:23] a quarter that of Google so so uh you have you have

[00:03:26] a search engine much much smaller than than air travel

[00:03:30] but much more valuable and I think this this reflects these very different

[00:03:34] uh valuations on X and Y so

[00:03:38] um you know if we look at perfect

[00:03:42] competition um you know there are sort of there's some pros

[00:03:46] and cons to the world of perfect competition um on a high

[00:03:49] level uh uh it's always um this is what you study in econ

[00:03:53] one it's always it's easy to model which I think is why econ professors

[00:03:57] like talking about perfect competition um it somehow is efficient

[00:04:01] especially in a world where things are static because you have all the consumer surplus gets

[00:04:05] captured by everybody and uh and politically it's uh What uh

[00:04:09] what we're what we're told is good in our society that you you want to have competition

[00:04:13] and this is somehow a good thing um of course there are a lot of negatives

[00:04:16] uh it's it's generally not that good if you're you're um you're involved

[00:04:20] in anything that's hyper competitive um because you often don't make money I'll

[00:04:24] come back to this a little bit later so uh so I think at one end of the spectrum

[00:04:27] you have uh industries that are perfectly competitive

[00:04:31] and at the other end of the spectrum um you have things

[00:04:34] that um I would say are monopolies and um and

[00:04:38] they're you know they're much stable longer term businesses you have

[00:04:42] more Capital uh and um and if you get a creative

[00:04:45] Monopoly for inventing something new I think it's symptomatic of

[00:04:49] having created something something really valuable um and so I do

[00:04:53] think this you know the the the sort of the the the extreme

[00:04:56] binary view of the world I I always articulate is that there are exactly

[00:05:00] two kinds of businesses in this world there are businesses that are perfectly competitive

[00:05:05] and there are businesses that are monopolies and um there's shockingly

[00:05:09] little that is in between and uh this dichotomy

[00:05:12] is not understood very well because uh people

[00:05:16] uh are constantly lying about the nature of the businesses

[00:05:20] they're in um and this is why this is in my mind this is the most important is

[00:05:23] not necessarily the most important thing in business but I think it's the most important business idea

[00:05:27] that people don't understand that there are just the two kinds of businesses

[00:05:31] and so let me say a little bit about the lies that people tell

[00:05:35] and so you basically um the basic uh if

[00:05:38] you sort of imagine that there was a spectrum of companies from

[00:05:42] perfect competition to Monopoly um the um

[00:05:46] the apparent differences are quite small because the people who

[00:05:49] have monopolies pretend not to they will basically say

[00:05:54] uh you know and it's because you don't want to get regulated by the government you don't want the government

[00:05:57] to come after you so you will never say that you have Monopoly so anyone who has a

[00:06:01] monopoly will pretend that they're in incredible

[00:06:04] competition and on the other end of the spectrum if you are incredibly

[00:06:09] competitive um and if you're in some sort of business where you will never make any

[00:06:12] money um you will be tempted to tell a lie

[00:06:16] that goes in the other direction where you will say that you're doing something unique

[00:06:20] um that um is is somehow uh less competitive

[00:06:24] than it looks because um because you want to

[00:06:28] you will want to differentiate you want to try to trct Capital or something like that

[00:06:32] so if the monopolists pretend not to have monopolies the non-

[00:06:35] monopolists pretend to have monopolies the apparent difference is very small

[00:06:39] whereas the real difference I I would submit is is actually quite

[00:06:43] big and so there's this Distortion that happens because of the

[00:06:47] lies people tell about their businesses and the lies are sort of

[00:06:50] in these these opposite direction let me let me drill a little bit down

[00:06:54] further on the uh the way these lies work

[00:06:58] and so um you know

[00:07:01] the the the basic uh lie you tell as a

[00:07:06] non-m monopoly is that we're in a very small Market the

[00:07:09] basic lie you tell as a monopoly is that the market you're in is much bigger

[00:07:13] than it looks and so um and so typically

[00:07:17] if you want to think of this in sort of set theoretic terms you could say that a monopoly

[00:07:21] tells um a a lie where you describe

[00:07:25] your business as the union of these vastly different markets

[00:07:29] and the non- monopolist describes it as the intersection

[00:07:33] so that uh in effect um if you're

[00:07:37] if you're a non- monopolist you will rhetorically describe your Market

[00:07:41] as super small you're the only person in that market if you

[00:07:44] have monopo you will describe it as super big

[00:07:48] and um and there's lots of competition in it so uh some

[00:07:52] examples of how this how this works in practice

[00:07:55] uh so I always use restaurants as the example of a terrible business

[00:07:59] this always you know sort of my idea is you know capitalism and competition are

[00:08:02] antonyms um capitalist is someone who accumulates Capital world of perfect

[00:08:06] competition is a world where all the capital gets competed away so

[00:08:10] uh you're opening a restaurant business no one wants to invest because you just lose

[00:08:13] money so you have to tell some idiosyncratic narrative and you will

[00:08:17] say something like well we're the only British food restaurant in paloalto

[00:08:21] so it's British paloalto and uh and of course

[00:08:25] that's too small a market because people may be able to drive all the way to

[00:08:28] Mountain View or even Meno Park um and there probably are

[00:08:32] no people who eat nothing but British food at least no people who are still

[00:08:36] alive and so so that is um that's that's a

[00:08:40] sort of a fictitiously narrow Market um

[00:08:44] there's there's sort of a Hollywood version of this where

[00:08:48] uh the way movies always get pitched is you know okay it's like a

[00:08:51] college football star you know uh joins

[00:08:55] an elite group of hackers to um to catch

[00:08:59] the shark that killed his friend um

[00:09:03] sorry and so that's now that is a movie that has

[00:09:07] not yet been made but um but

[00:09:11] but the question is is is that the right category or is the correct

[00:09:14] category it's just another movie in which case you know there are

[00:09:18] lots of those it's super competitive incredibly hard to make money

[00:09:21] no one ever makes money in Hollywood uh doing movies or it's really really

[00:09:26] hard and so you always have this question about does

[00:09:29] the intersection does is it real does it make sense does it

[00:09:33] have value that one should ask and of course there are startup versions of this

[00:09:37] where you and the the sort of the bad really bad versions you just take a whole

[00:09:40] series of buzzword sharing mobile social apps you

[00:09:44] combine them and you have some kind of uh narrative and whether or not

[00:09:47] that's a real business or not uh is is uh um is it's

[00:09:51] generally a bad sign so it's it's almost this pattern recognition when you have

[00:09:55] this rhetoric of the sort of intersections

[00:09:58] um it it it generally does not work the something of somewhere

[00:10:02] is really mostly just the nothing of nowhere and it's like the Stanford of

[00:10:06] North Dakota uh one of a kind but it's

[00:10:10] not Stanford um so let's

[00:10:13] look at the opposite the opposite law is um

[00:10:17] if you are uh let's say uh the uh the search uh

[00:10:21] company that's down the street from here and has about a happy

[00:10:24] 66% market share um and

[00:10:28] uh is you know is completely complely dominant in the search Market um

[00:10:31] Google has not almost never describes itself

[00:10:35] as a search engine these days um and instead it

[00:10:39] uh it describes itself in all these different ways so it sometimes says it's an advertising

[00:10:43] company so if it was search you'd say wow this this like it's

[00:10:47] it's it has this huge market share that's really really crazy it's it's

[00:10:50] like a incredible Monopoly it's much bigger than it's much a much more

[00:10:54] robust Monopoly than Microsoft ever had in the 90s maybe that's why it's

[00:10:57] making so much money um but if you uh if you say

[00:11:01] it's an advertising Market you could say well there's search advertising

[00:11:05] is 17 billion and that's part of

[00:11:09] uh online advertising which is much bigger and then

[00:11:12] you know all us advertising is bigger and then by the

[00:11:16] time you get to Global advertising that's close to 500 billion

[00:11:20] and so you're talking about 3 and a half% so

[00:11:24] um a tiny part of uh of this much larger

[00:11:27] market um or uh if you don't want to be an advertising

[00:11:31] company you can always say that you're a technology company

[00:11:35] um and so um

[00:11:39] sorry let me see um and so the

[00:11:43] and and so um and and the technology Market is something

[00:11:47] like a one trillion Doll Market and the narrative that you tell

[00:11:50] as Google in the in the technology Market is um well we're competing

[00:11:54] with all the car companies with our self-driving cars we're competing

[00:11:58] with Apple on TVs and iPhones

[00:12:02] uh we're competing with Facebook we're competing with Microsoft

[00:12:05] on um on Office Products we're competing with Amazon on cloud

[00:12:09] services and so we are in this giant technology

[00:12:12] Market where there's competition in every direction uh you you

[00:12:16] look and uh no we're not the Monopoly the government's looking for

[00:12:19] and we should not get regulated in any way whatsoever and so I think one

[00:12:23] has to always be super aware that there are these uh

[00:12:27] these very powerful incentives to to uh to distort

[00:12:30] uh the nature of these markets one way or or the other

[00:12:34] so um you know the the the evidence of narrow markets

[00:12:38] in the uh in the tech industry is um is if you basically

[00:12:42] just uh if you look at sort of the some

[00:12:46] of the big tech companies Apple Google Microsoft Amazon

[00:12:50] um they just um they've just been building up cash

[00:12:54] for um year after year and you have these incredibly High

[00:12:58] profit margins and I would I would say that the the one of

[00:13:01] the reasons the tech industry in the US has been

[00:13:05] uh has been so successful financially is because it's

[00:13:08] it's prone to creating all these Monopoly like businesses and that's

[00:13:12] that's um and it's reflected uh by the fact that these companies

[00:13:16] just accumulate so much cash they don't even know what what to do with it Beyond

[00:13:20] a certain point um and so so

[00:13:24] let me say um let me say a few things about uh

[00:13:28] about how to how to build a monopoly and I think uh I think

[00:13:31] the one of the sort of very counterintuitive

[00:13:35] ideas that comes out of this Monopoly uh thread

[00:13:39] is that um you want to go after small markets

[00:13:43] if you're a startup um you know you

[00:13:46] want to get to a monopoly you're starting a new company you want to get to Monopoly

[00:13:50] um Monopoly is you have a large share of a market how do you get

[00:13:54] to a large share of a market you start with a really small market

[00:13:57] and you take over that whole market and then uh and then over time

[00:14:01] you find ways to expand that market in in concentric circles

[00:14:06] and uh the thing that's always a big mistake is going after

[00:14:09] a giant market on on day one because that's

[00:14:13] typically evidence that um that you somehow haven't defined the

[00:14:16] categories correctly that and it's it normally means that there's going to be

[00:14:20] too much competition in one way or another and so I think

[00:14:24] almost all the successful companies uh in Silicon

[00:14:27] Valley had some model of starting with small

[00:14:31] markets and expanding and you know

[00:14:35] if you take Amazon you start with you start with you

[00:14:38] know just um a bookstore we have all the books

[00:14:42] in the world so it's it's a it's a it's a better bookstore than anybody

[00:14:46] else has in the world when it starts in the 90s it's online there's things you can do

[00:14:49] you can't do before and then you gradually expand into all

[00:14:53] sorts of different forms of e-commerce and other things beyond that

[00:14:57] um you know eBay you start with Pez dispensers

[00:15:01] you move on to beanie babies and eventually uh

[00:15:05] it's it's all these different um auctions for all these sorts

[00:15:09] of different Goods um and uh and what was very counterintuitive

[00:15:12] about what's very counterintuitive about many of these companies is they often start

[00:15:16] with markets that are so small that people don't think

[00:15:20] um they don't think that they're uh valuable at all when when you get

[00:15:24] started um the the PayPal version of this

[00:15:28] was uh was you know we started with uh with power sellers

[00:15:32] on eBay which was about 20,000 people when

[00:15:35] when we first saw this happening in December of 99 January 2000

[00:15:39] right after we launched uh there was a sense that uh that these were

[00:15:43] all um it was such a small Market it was terrible we thought these were

[00:15:46] terrible customers to have it's just people selling junk on the internet

[00:15:50] why in the world do we want to be going after this Market but um

[00:15:54] but you you know you there was a way to get a product that was much better for everybody in that

[00:15:58] market you could um and we got to something like 25

[00:16:01] 30% you know Market penetration in 2 or 3 months

[00:16:05] and you got some Walkin you got brand recognition and you're able to to build

[00:16:08] the business from there so um so I always think these um

[00:16:12] these these very small markets are are quite underrated uh the

[00:16:16] Facebook version of this I always give is that uh you know the initial

[00:16:19] Market at Facebook was 10,000 people at Harvard it went

[00:16:23] from 0 to 60% market share in 10 days that was a

[00:16:27] very auspicious start um the way this gets analyzed in Business

[00:16:30] Schools is always um that's ridiculous it's such a small Market it can't

[00:16:34] have any value at all and so I think the business school analysis of

[00:16:38] Facebook early on or of PayPal early on or

[00:16:41] of eBay early on is that the markets were perhaps so

[00:16:45] small as to have uh almost no value uh

[00:16:48] and they they would have had little value had they stayed small but it turned out

[00:16:52] there were ways to then grow them concentrically and that's what made them

[00:16:55] uh that's what made them so valuable um now I think the opposite

[00:16:59] version of this is always where you have super big markets

[00:17:03] and um and I there's so much so many different things that went wrong with all

[00:17:07] the clean tech companies in the last decade but

[00:17:11] uh but one one theme that ran through almost

[00:17:14] all of them was they all started with massive markets and every

[00:17:18] clean tech PowerPoint presentation that one saw in the Years

[00:17:22] 2005 to 2008 which was sort of the clean tech bubble in in Silicon

[00:17:26] Valley started with we're in the energy Market we're in a market

[00:17:29] that's measured in hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars

[00:17:33] and um and then you know once you're sort of a a minnow

[00:17:37] in a vast ocean um that's not a good place to be

[00:17:40] that means that you have tons of competitors and you don't even know who all the

[00:17:44] competitors are and so you want to be you know you want

[00:17:47] to be a one-of-a-kind company where it's the only one in

[00:17:51] a small ecosystem you don't want to be the fourth online pet food

[00:17:54] company you don't want to be the 10th thin film solar panel company

[00:17:58] you don't want to be the 100th restaurant in paloalto um you know restaurant industry

[00:18:02] is a trillion dollar industry so if you do a market size analysis youd include

[00:18:05] restaurants are a fantastic business to go into and it's often

[00:18:09] large markets large existing markets typically mean

[00:18:13] that you have uh tons of competition very very hard to

[00:18:17] uh to differentiate so the first very counterintuitive

[00:18:21] int uh idea is is to go after small markets

[00:18:25] often markets that are so small people don't even notice them they don't

[00:18:28] think they make sense that's where you get a foothold and then um

[00:18:32] and then if those markets are able to expand you can scale into

[00:18:36] a big monopo business um

[00:18:40] you know um a second uh sort of there's sort of several

[00:18:44] different uh characteristics of these Monopoly businesses um

[00:18:47] that I like to um focus on and U there's probably no

[00:18:51] no sort of single formula to it and I I always think that

[00:18:55] uh that in technology there's always a sense that you know the history of

[00:18:58] technology such that every every moment happens only

[00:19:02] once and so you know the next Mark Zuckerberg won't build a social network

[00:19:05] the next uh uh the next Larry Page won't be building a search engine

[00:19:09] the next uh Bill Gates won't be building an operating system and if you're copying

[00:19:13] these people you're not learning from them but it's it's and so um

[00:19:17] there is always um these very unique businesses that are doing

[00:19:20] something that's not been done before end up

[00:19:24] um end up having the potential to be a monopoly if you're you

[00:19:28] know the the the opening the opening line in um Anna Ken is

[00:19:31] that all happy companies sorry all happy families

[00:19:35] all happy families are alike all unhappy families are unhappy

[00:19:39] in their own special way and the opposite is true in business where I think

[00:19:42] all happy companies are different because they're doing something

[00:19:46] very unique all unhappy companies are alike because they fail

[00:19:50] to escape the essential sameness that is competition and so

[00:19:53] so one one sort of characteristic of a monopoly

[00:19:57] technology company is some sort of proprietary technology

[00:20:01] um my sort of crazy somewhat arbitrary rule of thumb

[00:20:05] is you want to have a technology that's an order of magnitude better

[00:20:09] than the next best thing so Amazon had over 10 times as many

[00:20:13] books I it's maybe not that Hightech but you figure out a way to sell 10 times as many books

[00:20:16] in an efficient online way you know PayPal the alternative

[00:20:20] for PayPal was using um was using uh uh checks

[00:20:24] to uh send money on eBay took 7 to 10 days to clear PayPal

[00:20:27] could do it than 10 times as fast so you want to have

[00:20:31] some sort of very uh very powerful Improvement

[00:20:35] in some um on in some order maybe an order of magnitude

[00:20:39] Improvement on some key Dimension um of course you know if you

[00:20:42] if you actually come with something totally new um it's it's

[00:20:46] it's just like an infinite Improvement so I would say the the iPhone was the first

[00:20:50] smartphone that worked and so that's you know that's like maybe maybe

[00:20:53] not infinite but it's sort of definitely an order of magnitude or more of

[00:20:57] an improvement so I think uh the the technology is designed

[00:21:01] to give you a massive Delta over over the next

[00:21:05] the next best thing I think um I think

[00:21:09] there often are network effects that can kick in that

[00:21:12] really help the thing that's very um and these these lead to monopolies over time

[00:21:16] the thing that's very tricky about Network effects is uh they're often

[00:21:20] uh they're often very hard to get started

[00:21:24] and so um so even though everyone understands how valuable they are uh there's

[00:21:27] always this incredible tricky question why is it valuable to the first person

[00:21:31] who's doing something um economies of scale

[00:21:35] uh if you have something that with very high fixed costs very low marginal

[00:21:39] costs uh that's typically a monopoly like business

[00:21:43] and then um then there's this thing uh of of branding

[00:21:46] uh which is sort of like just uh this idea that gets lodged in people's

[00:21:50] brains I I never quite understand how branding Works uh so I

[00:21:54] never invest in companies where it's just about branding but it is I think a real

[00:21:58] phenomenon that uh that creates uh that creates real value

[00:22:02] I think one of the things I'm going to come back to this a little bit towards the

[00:22:05] end but one of the things that's very striking is that software

[00:22:09] businesses are often um are for some reason

[00:22:13] uh very good at some of these things they're especially good at the economies of scale

[00:22:16] part because the marginal cost of software is zero

[00:22:20] and so if you get something that works in software um it's often

[00:22:24] significantly better than the existing solution and

[00:22:28] then you have these tremendous economies of scale and you can scale fairly

[00:22:31] quickly so even if the market start small um you can grow your business

[00:22:35] quickly enough to uh stay um stay at the same

[00:22:39] size as the growing market and uh and maintain the sort of

[00:22:43] Monopoly uh Power now the critical thing about

[00:22:46] these monopolies is um is it's it's not enough

[00:22:50] to have a monopoly for just a moment the critical thing is to

[00:22:54] have one that lasts over time um and so you know in Silicon

[00:22:57] value is the sort of idea that you want to be the first mover and I I

[00:23:01] always think it's it's in some ways um the better framing is

[00:23:05] you want to be the last mover you want to be the last company in a

[00:23:09] category those are the ones that are really valuable Microsoft was the

[00:23:12] last operating system at least for many decades uh Google is the last

[00:23:16] search engine Facebook will be valuable if it turns out to be the last

[00:23:20] social networking site and um and one way to

[00:23:23] one way to think of this uh last mover uh value

[00:23:27] is this idea that most to the value in these companies exists far

[00:23:31] in the future um if you do sort of a discounted cash

[00:23:34] flow analysis of a business you look at you have sort of all these profit streams

[00:23:38] you have a growth rate the growth rate's much higher than the discount rate

[00:23:42] and so most of the value exists far in the future I did I did

[00:23:46] this exercise at PayPal in March of 2001

[00:23:50] we had been in business for about 27 months and um

[00:23:54] and we sort of had you know the growth rate was 100% a year we were discounting future

[00:23:58] cash flows by about 30% and it turned out that about

[00:24:02] 3/4 of the value of the business as of 2001

[00:24:06] came from cash flows in years 2011 and Beyond

[00:24:10] and um and whenever you do the math on any of these tech companies you

[00:24:13] get to an answer that's something like that so if you are trying to analyze

[00:24:17] any of the tech companies in Silicon Valley Airbnb Twitter uh

[00:24:21] Facebook um any emerging internet companies all the ones in

[00:24:24] y combinator um the math tells you that

[00:24:28] three qus 80 85% of the value is

[00:24:32] coming from cash flows in years 2024 and Beyond it's

[00:24:35] very very far in the future and uh and so one of the things that

[00:24:39] uh we always overvalue in Silicon Valley is growth rates

[00:24:43] and we undervalue durability because uh growth is

[00:24:46] something you can measure in the here and now and you can always track that

[00:24:50] very precisely um the question of whether a company's still going to

[00:24:54] be around a decade from now that's actually what what dominates

[00:24:57] the value equation and that sort of is a much more uh qualitative

[00:25:01] sort of a thing and so if if we um if we went back to this

[00:25:05] idea of these characteristics of Monopoly uh proprietary technology

[00:25:09] Network effects economies of scale um

[00:25:13] um you can think of these these characteristics as ones that exist at a moment

[00:25:17] in time where you capture a market and take it over but you also want

[00:25:20] to think about are these things going to last over time

[00:25:24] and so there's a Time Dimension to all these characteristics so Network

[00:25:28] effects often have a great time element where as the network scales the

[00:25:31] network effects actually get more robust and so if you have a network effect business

[00:25:35] that's often one that uh um can become a

[00:25:38] um a bigger and stronger Monopoly over time

[00:25:42] a proprietary technology is always a little bit of a tricky one so

[00:25:46] you want something that's an order of magnitude better than uh

[00:25:50] the state-of-the-art in the world today and that's how you get people's

[00:25:54] attention that's how you initially break through but then um

[00:25:57] you don't want to be superseded by somebody else and so there are all these areas of

[00:26:01] innovation where there was tremendous Innovation but no one made

[00:26:04] any money so uh you know dis Drive Manufacturing in the 1980s

[00:26:09] um you could you could do a better dis build a better dis Drive than anybody

[00:26:12] else you could take over the whole world and two years later someone

[00:26:16] else would come along and replace yours and in the course of 15

[00:26:20] years you got vastly improved disc drives so it had

[00:26:23] great benefit to Consumers but um it didn't actually help the people

[00:26:27] who started these compan compies and so there's always this question about

[00:26:31] having a huge breakthrough in technology but then also

[00:26:35] being able to say explain why uh yours will be the last

[00:26:38] breakthrough uh or at least the last breakthrough for a long time or will

[00:26:42] you make a breakthrough and then you can keep improving on it at a

[00:26:46] quick enough Pace that no one can ever catch up so if you have a

[00:26:49] structure of um a structure of the future where

[00:26:53] there's a lot of innovation and other people will come up with new

[00:26:57] things in the thing you're working on um that's great for society

[00:27:00] it's um it's actually not that good for your business typically

[00:27:04] um and then um economies of scale uh where I talked about

[00:27:08] so so I think anyway so I think this last mover thing is is very critical I'm

[00:27:12] always tempted you know I don't want to overdo the chess analogies

[00:27:15] but you know the first mover in chess is someone who plays white white is

[00:27:19] about a one-third of a pawn Advantage so there's a small advantage to

[00:27:23] uh going first you want to be the last mover um who who

[00:27:26] wins the game and so so was the Kappa Blanca uh world champion

[00:27:30] uh uh chess champion Kappa Blanca line you must begin by studying the end

[00:27:34] game and and I do think that's um well I wouldn't say that's

[00:27:37] the only thing you should study I think this uh the sort of perspective of

[00:27:41] asking these questions why will this still be the leading company 10 15

[00:27:45] 20 years from now is a uh is a really critical one to to try to

[00:27:48] think through let me um

[00:27:52] let me sort of uh I want to sort of go in two slightly other directions

[00:27:56] with this Monopoly versus competition idea and I think

[00:28:00] um so I think this is the the central

[00:28:04] idea uh in my mind for for business for starting business for thinking about them

[00:28:08] and U and there are some some very um interesting perspectives I think it gives

[00:28:12] on the whole you know on the whole history of innovation and

[00:28:15] technology and science because um you know we we've lived

[00:28:19] through um we've lived through um you

[00:28:23] know 250 300 years of incredible technological

[00:28:27] progress in you know many many different domains uh you know

[00:28:30] steam engine to Railways to

[00:28:35] telephones Refrigeration household appliances

[00:28:38] um you know the computer Revolution Aviation

[00:28:42] all sorts of different areas of technological innovation and then

[00:28:46] there's sort of analogous thing that one can say about science where

[00:28:49] uh we've lived through centuries of of enormous amounts of innovation

[00:28:53] in in in science as well and um

[00:28:57] and the the thing that I think um people always miss

[00:29:00] when they think about these things is um is that

[00:29:04] um because X and Y are independent variables

[00:29:08] um some of these things can be extremely valuable Innovations

[00:29:12] but uh the people who invent them who come up with them do not get rewarded

[00:29:16] for this and uh and certainly if you go back to um you need to

[00:29:20] create X dollars in value you capture y% of X

[00:29:23] I would suggest that the history of science has generally been one

[00:29:27] where y 0% across the board the scientists

[00:29:30] never make any money um they're always duded into thinking

[00:29:34] that they live in a just universe that will reward them for their work

[00:29:38] and for their inventions and this is probably the fundamental delusion

[00:29:41] that uh that scientists tend to suffer from in our in our society

[00:29:46] um and and even in technology there are sort of many different areas

[00:29:50] of Technology where um where there were great innovations

[00:29:53] that created tremendous value for society but uh but

[00:29:57] people did not uh did not actually capture uh

[00:30:01] that much of the of the value and so I think there is this sort of

[00:30:04] whole uh history of um science and technology

[00:30:09] that can be told from the perspective of how much value was

[00:30:12] actually captured and um and certainly

[00:30:17] there are entire sectors where people didn't capture anything

[00:30:20] so you you're the smartest physicist of the 20th century you come

[00:30:24] up with special relativity you come up with general relativity you don't

[00:30:27] get to be a billionaire you don't even get to be a millionaire um it

[00:30:31] just it just somehow doesn't work that way um the railroads

[00:30:35] incredibly valuable most of them just went bankrupt because it was too much

[00:30:39] competition um right Brothers um you fly the first

[00:30:42] plane you don't make any money and so I think there is sort of the structure to these

[00:30:46] industries that's uh that's very important um and I think

[00:30:49] the uh the thing that's actually rare are the success cases

[00:30:53] most the so it's actually you really think about the history in this in this 250

[00:30:57] years sweep um it's unus Y is almost always 0%

[00:31:01] it's always zero in science it's almost always in in technology and

[00:31:05] so it's very rare where people made money you know the early

[00:31:08] uh the late uh 18th early 19th century the first Industrial Revolution

[00:31:12] was the textile mills you had the steam engine you sort of automated things

[00:31:16] and you had these Relentless improvements that people improved efficiency of

[00:31:20] textile factories of manufacturing generally at a clip of

[00:31:23] 5 to 7% every year year after year decade after

[00:31:27] decade you had 60 70 years of tremendous improvement

[00:31:31] from 1780 to 1850

[00:31:35] um but even in 1850 most of the wealth in Britain

[00:31:38] was still held by the landed aristocracy uh the workers didn't

[00:31:42] you know the workers didn't make that much the capitalists didn't make that much either it was all

[00:31:46] competed away there were hundreds of people running textile factories

[00:31:49] it was an industry that just uh um the structure of the competition

[00:31:53] prevented people uh from from making any money um and

[00:31:57] so I I think there are in my mind there probably are only

[00:32:01] two broad categories in the entire history of the last 250

[00:32:04] years where people have actually uh come up with new things

[00:32:08] and made money doing so um one is uh these sort of vertically

[00:32:12] integrated complex monopolies which people uh

[00:32:16] did build in the Second Industrial Revolution at the end of the 19th

[00:32:19] and start of the 20th century and so this was like Ford it was the vertically

[00:32:23] integrated oil companies like Standard Oil um and what these

[00:32:27] vertically integrated monopolies uh typically required was this very

[00:32:30] complex coordination you got a lot of pieces to fit together in

[00:32:34] just the right way uh when you assembled it you had a tremendous

[00:32:38] Advantage this is actually uh done surprisingly little today

[00:32:41] and so I think this is sort of a business form that um

[00:32:45] when people can pull it off is very valuable it's typically fairly

[00:32:49] Capital intensive uh we live sort of in a in a in a culture where

[00:32:53] it's very hard to get people to buy into anything

[00:32:57] that's super complicated and takes very long to build

[00:33:00] uh but I you know when I sort of think about my colleague Elon Musk from

[00:33:04] PayPal success with Tesla and SpaceX uh

[00:33:07] I think the key to these companies was the complex vertically

[00:33:11] integrated Monopoly structure they had so if you sort of look at

[00:33:15] Tesla or SpaceX if you ask you know was there sort of a single

[00:33:19] breakthrough I mean they certainly innovated on a LW of Dimensions

[00:33:22] I don't think there was a single 10x breakthrough in battery storage

[00:33:26] or you know maybe working on some things on rocketry but

[00:33:30] they hadn't there was no sort of single massive breakthrough but

[00:33:34] what was really impressive was integrating all these pieces together

[00:33:38] and um and doing it in a way that was more vertically integrated than most of their

[00:33:41] competitors so Tesla you also integrated The Car Distributors so they

[00:33:45] wouldn't uh steal all the money as has happened with the rest of the car industry

[00:33:49] in the US or SpaceX um you basically

[00:33:52] uh pulled in all the subcontractors um uh where

[00:33:56] most of the large uh Aerospace companies have single Source subcontractors

[00:34:00] that are able to sort of charge Monopoly profits

[00:34:03] and make it very hard for the integrated aerospace companies to make money

[00:34:07] um and so uh vertical integration I think is sort of a a very

[00:34:11] underexplored modality of of technological progress that

[00:34:14] people uh would uh would do well to look at more

[00:34:18] and then I think there is there is something about software itself

[00:34:22] that's very very powerful um software has these incredible

[00:34:26] economies of scale these low margin costs and there is something

[00:34:29] about the world of bits as opposed to the world of atoms where you can often

[00:34:33] get very fast adoption and and the fast adoption is critical to

[00:34:37] capturing and taking over markets because even if you have a small

[00:34:41] Market if the adoption rate is too slow there'll be enough time for other people

[00:34:44] to enter that market and compete with you whereas if you have a

[00:34:48] small to midsized Market and have a fast adoption rate you can uh

[00:34:51] take over this market and so and so I think this is one of the reasons Silicon

[00:34:55] Valley has done so well and why software has been of this

[00:34:59] phenomenal industry and what I what I would suggest

[00:35:02] what I would want to leave you with is there are sort of these different rationalizations

[00:35:06] people give for why certain things work and

[00:35:10] why certain things don't work and I think these rationalizations always

[00:35:13] obscure this question of um creating X Dollar in

[00:35:17] value and capturing y% of X so the science rationalization

[00:35:21] we're always told is that the scientists aren't interested in making money

[00:35:25] they're doing it for charitable reasons and that not a good scientist if

[00:35:28] you're motivated by money and I'm not even saying people should always

[00:35:32] be motivated by money or something like this but I I think we should

[00:35:35] we should be a little bit more critical of this as a rationalization we should

[00:35:39] ask is this a rationalization um uh to

[00:35:43] obscure the fact that y equals 0% and the scientists are operating

[00:35:47] in this uh in this sort of world where all the uh all the Innovation

[00:35:51] is effectively competed away and they can't capture any of it directly

[00:35:55] and then the uh the software Distortion that often happens

[00:35:59] is because people are making such vast Fortunes in software we

[00:36:03] infer that this is the most valuable thing um in the world being done

[00:36:07] full stop and so if people at Twitter make uh billions

[00:36:10] of dollars it must be that Twitter is worth far more than anything

[00:36:14] Einstein did um and um and uh and

[00:36:18] what that sort of rationalization tends to obscure is again that X and Y

[00:36:21] are independent variables and there are these businesses where you capture a

[00:36:25] lot of X and there are others where you don't and so uh and so I do think

[00:36:28] um I do think the history of innovation has been this uh

[00:36:32] this history where uh the the the the microeconomics

[00:36:36] the structure of these industries has mattered a tremendous amount and when

[00:36:39] um and um and and and there is sort of this

[00:36:43] the story where some people have made vast fortunes because they were in Industries

[00:36:47] with the right structure and other people uh made uh nothing

[00:36:51] at all because um because they were in these sort of very competitive

[00:36:55] things and we shouldn't just rationalize that way I think it's worth understanding this

[00:36:58] better and then finally let me come back to this

[00:37:02] this uh this sort of overarching theme for this talk this competition is

[00:37:06] for losers idea which um is always this provocative

[00:37:10] way to to title things because we always think of the losers

[00:37:14] as the people who are not good at competing we think of the losers as

[00:37:18] the people who are um slow on the sports on the track

[00:37:21] team in high school or who do a little bit less well on the standardized

[00:37:25] tests um and don't get into the right schools and so we

[00:37:28] always think of losers as people who can't compete um and I want

[00:37:32] us to really rethink and and revalue this and consider

[00:37:36] whether it's possible that competition itself um

[00:37:40] is off that we we we're sort of it's not just the case that we don't

[00:37:43] understand this Monopoly competition dichotomy intellectually so

[00:37:47] sort of been talking about why why you wouldn't understand it intellectually because um

[00:37:51] people lie about it it's distorted we have all these uh

[00:37:55] the history of innovation rationalizes what happen in all these very very

[00:37:58] strange ways but I think it's more than just an intellectual blind spot I think it's

[00:38:02] also a psychological blind spot where we find ourselves you

[00:38:05] know very very attracted to competition in in one form or another

[00:38:10] um we find it reassuring if other people do things the word

[00:38:13] ape already in the time of Shakespeare meant both primate and imitate

[00:38:17] uh and there is something about human nature that's deeply mimetic

[00:38:21] imitative apik sheeplike leming like cd-like um

[00:38:25] and it's this very very problem uh thing that we

[00:38:29] need to always think through and try to overcome and and there is

[00:38:33] always this question about um competition

[00:38:36] um as as a form of validation where we we go

[00:38:40] for things that lots of other people are going for and um

[00:38:44] it's not that there is wisdom in crowds it's not when lots of people are trying to do something

[00:38:47] that that's proof of uh it being valuable I think it's when lots of people are trying

[00:38:51] to do something that is often um that is often proof of insanity

[00:38:55] there 20,000 people a year who move to Los Angeles to become movie stars

[00:38:59] about 20 of them make it um I think the Olympics are a little bit better

[00:39:03] because you have a you know um you can sort of figure out pretty quickly whether

[00:39:06] you're good or not so it's there's a little bit less of a dead weight loss to

[00:39:10] society um you know um um you know

[00:39:14] your your the sort of educational experience at a place uh the the the

[00:39:17] pre- Stanford educational experience um there's always sort of a non-competitive

[00:39:21] characterization I think most of the people in this room had machine guns they were competing

[00:39:25] with people with bows and arrows so um it wasn't exactly a parallel

[00:39:29] competition when you were in junior high school and high school um there's always a

[00:39:32] question does the tournament make sense as you keep going and this is uh

[00:39:36] and so um there is always this question if people go on to grad school

[00:39:40] or post post-doctoral educations does the intensity of

[00:39:44] the competition really makes sense there's the uh the you know classic

[00:39:47] uh Henry Kissinger line that uh um describing his fellow

[00:39:51] faculty at Harvard that the uh um the battles

[00:39:55] were so ferocious because the stakes were so small describing sort of Academia

[00:39:59] and um and and you sort of think on one level this is a description of insanity

[00:40:03] you know why would people fight like crazy when the stakes are so small

[00:40:07] but it's also I think simply a function of the logic of the situation

[00:40:11] when it's imp really hard to differentiate yourself from other people

[00:40:14] when the differences are when the objective differences really are small

[00:40:18] then uh you have to uh compete ferociously to maintain

[00:40:22] uh a difference of one sort uh or another um that's often

[00:40:25] more imaginary than real there's always sort of a personal

[00:40:29] uh version of this that I I tell where um you know I was sort of hyper

[00:40:33] hypert tracked I you know my e8th grade Junior High School yearbook one of my friends

[00:40:36] wrote in you know I know you'll get into Stanford in four years as a

[00:40:40] sophomore I sort of went into went to Stanford four years later uh at

[00:40:44] the end of High School uh went to Stanford Law School

[00:40:47] uh you know ended up um at a big law firm in uh New York uh

[00:40:51] where from the outside everybody wanted to get in on the inside everybody

[00:40:54] wanted to leave um and and you had um

[00:40:58] and it was this very strange Dynamic where after I uh sort of realized

[00:41:02] this was maybe not the best idea um and left

[00:41:05] after seven months and 3 days you know one of the people down the hall from me

[00:41:09] uh told me um it's really reassuring to see you leave Peter I had no idea

[00:41:13] that it was possible to escape from alcatra which of course all you had

[00:41:17] to do was go out the front door and not come back but um but

[00:41:20] so much of people's identities got wrapped up in

[00:41:24] um in winning uh these competitions that uh they somehow

[00:41:27] lost sight of what was important what was valuable uh you know competition

[00:41:31] does make you better at whatever it is that you're competing on because

[00:41:35] when you're competing you're um comparing yourself with the people around you

[00:41:39] you're figuring out how do I beat the people next to me how do I do somewhat better

[00:41:42] at whatever it is they're doing and you will get better at that thing I'm

[00:41:46] not I'm not questioning that I'm not denying that but um but it

[00:41:49] often comes at this tremendous price that uh you stop asking

[00:41:53] some bigger questions about what's truly important and truly Valu

[00:41:57] and so I would I would say that don't always go through the tiny

[00:42:01] little door that everyone's trying to rush through maybe go around the corner and go

[00:42:04] through the vast gate that no one's taking thank you very

[00:42:09] much I guess we time for you want to take

[00:42:12] a few questions

[00:42:16] or sorry

[00:42:20] oh yeah people want to take I'll take a few questions we have a few minutes time

[00:42:24] yeah go ahead um since yeah as you mentioned earlier often

[00:42:28] monopolies and competition often look similar because the narratives

[00:42:32] people tell the narratives we tell ourselves do you have any ways

[00:42:35] to easily determine the difference when you're looking at an idea or evaluating your

[00:42:39] own idea well I'd say the question I'm I always try

[00:42:42] to focus on is what is the actual market so not what's The Narrative of the

[00:42:46] market because you can always tell a fictional story about a market that's much bigger or much

[00:42:49] smaller but what is the what is the real objective market

[00:42:53] so it's always yeah you always try to figure it out and you realize people have incentive

[00:42:57] to distort things yeah

[00:43:01] so which of the aspects of monop that you mentioned would you say s

[00:43:04] like Google um well

[00:43:08] they have uh they have Network effects with the the ad Network

[00:43:12] they had proprietary technology that gave them the initial lead because they had the the page

[00:43:16] rank algorithm which was uh sort of an order of magnitude better than any other

[00:43:19] search search engine you have economies of scale

[00:43:23] uh because of the need to store you know all these different uh sites

[00:43:27] and at this point you have brand so Google has all four maybe maybe the proprietary

[00:43:30] technology is somewhat weaker at this point but definitely it had all four

[00:43:34] and maybe three and a half out of four now yeah how does

[00:43:37] this apply to paler and second what's you like

[00:43:41] second is what what with the iPhone uh head oh this is that's that's

[00:43:45] a that's a there sort of a set of companies that are doing different copycat

[00:43:49] payment systems on on mobile phones there's square there's PayPal sort

[00:43:53] of they have just they just have sort of different shapes that's how they differentiate themselves one is a triangle

[00:43:57] one is a square um and so you know um maybe

[00:44:00] at some point the Apes will run out of shapes or something like that but um but I think um

[00:44:04] no palent here we we started with a focus on on um the

[00:44:08] um intelligence Community which is small submarket um you had

[00:44:11] a proprietary technology that used a very very different approach

[00:44:15] um uh where it was focused on the

[00:44:19] human um computer uh synthesis rather

[00:44:23] than the uh uh sub substitution which I think is the dominant Paradigm

[00:44:26] so there's a whole set of things I would say on the on the market approach and the

[00:44:30] the proprietary technology uh yes

[00:44:34] um we have design thinking methodology and uh lean

[00:44:38] uh startup thinking um which is used to

[00:44:42] mitigate Risk by not creating things that people don't want but how do young innovators

[00:44:46] uh have inspiration to create complex systems that last

[00:44:50] through time can you repeat the question yeah so the question is um what

[00:44:53] do I think about lean startups uh um iterative thinking where you get uh

[00:44:57] feedback from people uh versus uh complexity that may not

[00:45:00] work so I I am personally quite skeptical of all

[00:45:04] the uh Lean Startup methodology I think the the the really great

[00:45:08] companies um did something was sort of somewhat more of

[00:45:11] a Quantum Improvement that really differentiated them from everybody

[00:45:15] else um they they typically did not do

[00:45:19] massive you know customer surveys the people who ran these companies

[00:45:23] uh sometimes not always suffered from mild forms of Asbergers so they we not

[00:45:27] actually that influenced not that easily deterred by what other people thought or told

[00:45:30] them to do um so I I do think we're we're way too

[00:45:34] focused on um iteration as a modality and not enough

[00:45:38] on trying to um have um you know um

[00:45:41] a virtual ESP link with the public and figuring it out ourselves

[00:45:45] um I I would say that uh let me see um I

[00:45:49] would say that uh the um I I'm not quite the risk

[00:45:53] question I think is always a very tricky one because there are um

[00:45:57] you know there there it's it's not it's often I think it's often

[00:46:01] the case that you don't have enough time to really mitigate risks

[00:46:04] if you if you're going to take enough time to figure out what people want um you

[00:46:08] often will have missed the boat by then um and um

[00:46:12] and then of course there's always the risk of of doing something

[00:46:16] that's uh that's not that uh significant or meaningful so you know you

[00:46:20] you could say a track in um in law school is

[00:46:23] a lowrisk track from one perspective it may still be

[00:46:27] a very highrisk track in the sense that maybe you not um have a high risk

[00:46:30] of not doing something meaningful with your life so we have to think about risk in

[00:46:34] these uh in these very complicated way I think risk is sort of this very uh

[00:46:38] complicated concept yes you talking about the last move Advantage

[00:46:41] but then doesn't that imply that there's already competition to begin with chest piece

[00:46:45] on the chest board um yeah so there's

[00:46:49] always this uh terminology thing so I I would say that uh there

[00:46:52] are uh there are categories in which people sort of are bundled

[00:46:57] together I would say the Monopoly businesses were in

[00:47:00] in effect they they really were a big first mover in some sense you could

[00:47:04] say you could say Google was not the first search engine there were other search engines

[00:47:07] before but on one dimension they were dramatically better than everybody

[00:47:11] else so they were the first one with page rank with with sort of a automated

[00:47:15] approach um Facebook was not the first uh social networking

[00:47:19] site my friend Reed Hoffman started one in 1997

[00:47:22] they called it social net so they already had the name social networking

[00:47:26] uh in the name of their company seven years before Facebook uh

[00:47:29] their idea was that it was going to be this virtual cyers space where I'd be a dog

[00:47:33] and you'd be a cat and we'd have all these different rules about how we'd interact with each other

[00:47:37] in this virtual alternate reality Facebook was the first one to get real identity

[00:47:41] so it was so I'd say I hope Facebook will be the last social networking

[00:47:45] site it was the first one in a very important Dimension people often

[00:47:49] would not think of it as the first because they'd sort of lump all these things together

[00:47:53] I have one more question okay one more question let's take one here uh if theoretically

[00:47:57] someone who uh worked at Goldman Sachs out of college and left out

[00:48:01] 6 months and is now studying computer science at Stanford uh how

[00:48:04] would you recommend rethinking

[00:48:12] that um you know I don't I don't have a

[00:48:15] I don't have a great um I'm not great at the Psychotherapy stuff so

[00:48:19] I don't I don't quite know how to I don't quite know how to uh how to

[00:48:23] solve this that there are these um you know there are these very odd stud

[00:48:27] they've done on people who go to um business school there one they've done at Harvard Business

[00:48:30] School where um it's sort of the anti- asberg

[00:48:34] um personality where you have people who are super extroverted uh generally

[00:48:38] have low convictions uh few ideas and you have sort of

[00:48:41] a hot house environment you put all these people in for two years and at the

[00:48:45] end of it uh they systematically end up the largest cohort

[00:48:48] systematically ends up doing the wrong thing they try to catch the last wave

[00:48:52] you know uh 1989 everyone at Harvard tried to work for Mike milin it was one or two

[00:48:56] years before he went to jail for all the junk bond stuff they were never interested

[00:48:59] in Silicon Valley OR tech except for 99 2000 when they timed the

[00:49:03] bubble peing perfectly um they did uh and

[00:49:07] then you know 05 to7 was housing uh private Equity stuff like

[00:49:10] this so so I do think um I do think this

[00:49:14] uh tendency for us to see competition as validation

[00:49:18] is um is very deep um I don't think

[00:49:21] there's some any sort of easy psychological formula to uh

[00:49:25] to avoid it so I don't I I don't quite know how to uh what sort of therapy

[00:49:29] to to recommend but um but my my my first

[00:49:33] my first starting point which is only like it's maybe 10% of the way

[00:49:36] is to never underestimate how big a problem it is we always think this is

[00:49:40] something that afflicts other people so it's easy for me to point to people in Business Schools

[00:49:43] or people at Harvard or people on Wall Street I think it actually does

[00:49:47] afflict all of us to a very profound degree we always think of advertising is things

[00:49:51] that work on other people how who are all these stupid people who fall for All

[00:49:54] Those ads on TV they obviously work to some extent and they

[00:49:58] work uh to a disturbing extent on all of us and it's something we we all should work to

[00:50:02] overcome thank you very much
