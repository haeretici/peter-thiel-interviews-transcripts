[Post Seed Conference 2014 - Special One-Hour Session with Peter Thiel and Bambi Francisco](https://youtu.be/9ARjQONc6WU)

[00:00:01] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[00:00:28] n Vader and

[00:00:32] Venture 51 and Bullpen the hosts of

[00:00:36] post seed purchased 200 books and hopefully

[00:00:40] you picked up the books out there they finally arrived and after

[00:00:44] this interview Peter will actually be signing some books so

[00:00:48] um of course you'll be sticking around for that because that's during lunch so Peter

[00:00:51] congratulations on the books 100,000 books

[00:00:55] have been sold already that's amazing and you you've hit

[00:00:59] the New York Times best seller list Amazon bestseller list

[00:01:03] and it's it's now published in 18 languages

[00:01:06] congratulations we don't have fully an 18 it's going to be going to be 18 over the next few

[00:01:10] months well congratulations I I I think uh it's a great

[00:01:13] job on the book get great contribution to the

[00:01:17] entrepreneurs and to investors and um it's a very multi-disciplinary

[00:01:21] book and and as I as I read it I thought that you know

[00:01:24] I thought a lot about um I've known you now for 15 years and I thought

[00:01:29] this is just this is Peter this is his approach to life

[00:01:33] to questions to topics um always very multifaceted

[00:01:37] I remember we met when you were the CEO of PayPal and

[00:01:40] you were one of the few CEOs I could talk to about

[00:01:44] not just startups but about public company valuations

[00:01:48] about um the macroeconomy about philosophy and

[00:01:52] and I bring that up because this conversation today will

[00:01:55] be very broad we're not just going to talk about seed stage investing

[00:01:59] but um a number of topics um but we we'll start with seed stage

[00:02:03] investing because most people here are probably either

[00:02:07] investors in the post seed or series a and a lot of the

[00:02:10] startups here have probably received their seed and are curious

[00:02:14] about um what's happening in you know the early stages so 10

[00:02:18] years ago you put your you put $500,000

[00:02:22] into Facebook 2004 a lot has changed

[00:02:26] in the last decade in when it comes to seed stage investing

[00:02:30] um besides the fact that there's more of it what

[00:02:33] do you think the biggest changes are in the last decade decade and is it

[00:02:37] harder easier as an investor

[00:02:41] um well I would say the uh the default is that

[00:02:44] it's it's certainly it certainly seems somewhat harder than a decade

[00:02:48] ago I think there are uh you know I I think the the good thing

[00:02:52] is that there are um more great companies being started now than they

[00:02:55] were being started a decade ago I think the uh the

[00:02:59] challenge is that um there are there are more investors

[00:03:02] competing uh for uh to invest in these opportunities and there's

[00:03:06] a sense in which uh uh the valuations often

[00:03:10] have seem seem quite a bit higher so the the Facebook investment

[00:03:13] in summer of 2004 was at a $5 million

[00:03:17] valuation um it was already at 20 college campuses

[00:03:21] they had 100,000 people signed up um they were going to launch to

[00:03:24] 100 more colleges in the fall and so uh if you had

[00:03:28] those kinds of metrics for business today um I think the

[00:03:32] the valuation would probably be sort of an order of magnitude

[00:03:36] higher probably be valued at 50 million or 100 million

[00:03:39] so um so that would have still been a good investment but

[00:03:43] um but so I think it has become um it has become quite a bit more

[00:03:46] challenging you know if you if you look at uh at y combinator sort of a

[00:03:50] metric um you know 05 06 uh you could

[00:03:53] invest in the companies at demo day and Y combinator at

[00:03:57] valuations at 1 and a half to $2 million

[00:04:01] um and sort of fast forward 8 n years um

[00:04:04] it's again maybe not quite a zero more but

[00:04:08] it's close maybe 8 to 10x of what it was eight years ago

[00:04:12] average seed stage deal would be now

[00:04:15] valuation wise you know it's I think these things are always you know a bit of a

[00:04:20] a term you know there's no clear definition between

[00:04:23] C and series a and and all these things but uh but yeah I

[00:04:27] think I think uh I think sort of you you you

[00:04:30] you can see things anywhere I mean you can still see things at three four million you can see things at

[00:04:34] 8 million 10 million there's some you know where people have experience

[00:04:38] they've done it before um and you get sort of into you know

[00:04:41] High you know 15 18 million seed round

[00:04:46] if it's a repeat entrepreneur there's some reputation um

[00:04:50] I I I'm I'm never quite sure um that

[00:04:54] valuation valuation is very important but uh

[00:04:58] but it's often a mistake to too price sensitive so uh

[00:05:01] so when I've looked at the The Venture investing that uh Angel

[00:05:05] inventure Investing I've done over the last decade uh

[00:05:09] it's probably the best investments

[00:05:13] um there have been a few Investments where it was just um you know

[00:05:16] sort of very opportunistic and somehow was actually cheap

[00:05:20] I think Facebook summer of 04 would would count in that category

[00:05:24] uh but I think um I think most of it has actually been

[00:05:28] where it would is the things that felt expensive that turned

[00:05:32] out to still be the good Investments and the ones that felt

[00:05:36] uh cheap were often just uh bad companies

[00:05:40] and so um and so uh you know we invested in the

[00:05:44] series C round at Facebook uh spring of 2006

[00:05:48] the valuation was 525 million pre um you know they were

[00:05:51] up to 39 million revenues was still not profitable that felt

[00:05:55] you know really really expensive and that turned out to be the

[00:05:59] best best investment we made you know in in uh in the first

[00:06:03] uh in Founders fund one and uh and I think something

[00:06:07] like that's been been true of a lot of these things so uh so

[00:06:10] um you you want you want always be somewhat sensitive to valuation

[00:06:14] but I think it's a much more important variable what the quality of the team or

[00:06:17] the quality of the idea is so you know seed valuations maybe they can range

[00:06:21] by a factor of 10 could be 2 million it could be 20

[00:06:25] um but the outcomes at the end of the day they can vary by a factor of

[00:06:28] 10,000 and you know you were much better off being the

[00:06:32] 100th employee at Google on customer service

[00:06:36] than being the uh the uh CEO of the average

[00:06:40] series a venture capital funded company in Silicon

[00:06:44] Valley um over the last uh over the last decade

[00:06:47] and so so I think one of the things that's always very counterintuitive

[00:06:51] is is that there's this incredible power law where uh when things

[00:06:54] work they work far better and you know we're and uh it's it's very different

[00:06:58] from what we're taught sort of in in um in elementary school

[00:07:02] or or high school um you know it's um you know it may

[00:07:05] be the case that all um you know all people are

[00:07:09] created equal certainly all companies are not created equal

[00:07:13] and the amount of inequality that exists between companies is

[00:07:16] I think much greater than people generally understand

[00:07:20] I want to touch on something you just said earlier about how it's probably a

[00:07:23] little bit more challenging today to be an investor particularly

[00:07:27] in the early stages and what you're seeing now

[00:07:31] because there's so many companies and because it's cheaper to start a company

[00:07:35] you're seeing a lot of investors uh

[00:07:39] strategies basically um following

[00:07:42] the Ron Conway strategy of diversification Google Ventures

[00:07:46] invest in 80 companies a year 500 startups is probably at

[00:07:50] 700 800 companies already in the last 5 years

[00:07:54] but you actually say that um you're

[00:07:57] skeptical of diversification and and you say

[00:08:01] that you're skeptical because investors are treating companies like

[00:08:05] lottery tickets so I guess ethically maybe it's not

[00:08:09] the right way to invest but economically isn't there

[00:08:12] validity to this uh diversification strategy

[00:08:16] given that it's really tough to to know who the winners are at the seed

[00:08:19] stage well um well you you always you end up you know

[00:08:23] to theend you invest in more than one company you end up implicitly

[00:08:26] diversifying so obviously I'm not um saying that and you should put all

[00:08:30] your eggs in just one basket or or something uh something like that

[00:08:34] but I I do think that um I do think there's probably

[00:08:38] sort of treating it as a portfolio or as a sort of massively Diversified

[00:08:42] strategy um I tend to think is a bit of a mistake

[00:08:46] and it's sort of a mistake on two different levels I I certainly don't I don't

[00:08:49] like the way you end up interacting with the companies where if everyone's just a

[00:08:53] lottery ticket that sort of creates a somewhat dysfunctional

[00:08:57] relationship between the investor and the on entrepreneur where you're

[00:09:00] sort of uh fundamentally in a very different Zone you want the entrepreneur to take enormous

[00:09:04] risk and it's just this tiny uh uh it's not even

[00:09:08] much of a risk for you at all so you're sort of very misaligned on that

[00:09:11] level but um but what I've also found is that when you

[00:09:15] think of it as a lottery ticket when you say well you know this might work

[00:09:19] it might not work I don't really know it's a lottery ticket um

[00:09:22] you've already psyched yourself into losing and so um whenever

[00:09:26] you know a lottery ticket multiply a small probability by a big number

[00:09:31] it's normally a zero it's normally you know when you multiply small number by a big number it's

[00:09:34] a small number and and and when you play the lottery and

[00:09:38] um and something like that if you have that sort of attitude towards

[00:09:42] um towards investing in uh startups uh

[00:09:45] the problem is there are far too many lottery tickets you can buy

[00:09:49] there are far too many different companies that are um

[00:09:53] that that that are out there and uh and so you've sort of talked yourself

[00:09:57] into not doing um not uh doing

[00:10:01] quite as much work and um and what you know

[00:10:04] where where we've done best over the years is when

[00:10:08] um we had sort of a lot of conviction and we're willing to put a lot of money into

[00:10:12] things and then systematically the points where we had less

[00:10:16] conviction invested smaller dollar amounts those have actually

[00:10:19] done much worse and so i' I found that it's always it's always

[00:10:23] easy to say don't really know I'll just do half

[00:10:26] and I think that's always the Temptation that uh that one should uh one should resist

[00:10:30] very strenuously one one other version of this um is

[00:10:34] that you know you have a lot of these seed stage uh opportunities

[00:10:37] where you have 10 different people it's like maybe they're raising a million

[00:10:41] dollars and 10 people are investing a h 100,000 each um

[00:10:45] and against my my instinct is um as a default

[00:10:48] to almost stay away from a company like that because

[00:10:52] if you have 10 different investors investing uh you might

[00:10:56] say wow there 10 different people who've thought about it so way more

[00:10:59] people have dced it um but I think in reality

[00:11:03] what happens far more typically is that each of those people

[00:11:06] is counting on the other people to do their work no one's really done any

[00:11:10] work and so um so I and I suspect that um you

[00:11:14] it's very hard to get scientific data on this but if we if we actually looked at

[00:11:17] um uh sort of deals that had many different investors

[00:11:21] I think those typically have underperformed ones in which you had a more limited

[00:11:25] number because um even though the naive view would be you have 20 investors

[00:11:29] they you've had 20 people think about it versus say two investors

[00:11:33] and you've had two people think about it and put in more money and putting in more money

[00:11:37] I think the reality is you have two and they've really thought about it versus 20

[00:11:40] and it turns out nobody has but I think today there's more

[00:11:44] I think people are open to that I mean over the last five years people

[00:11:48] are more open to taking you know 25,000 $50,000

[00:11:52] checks from multiple people um you know having

[00:11:56] maybe investors having 15 20 investors

[00:12:00] um putting in $100,000 I I don't see what

[00:12:04] is so wrong with um you know getting

[00:12:07] a $100,000 check I mean you write $250,000 checks well

[00:12:11] I don't think it's I don't think there's anything morally wrong with it and I think people have a they

[00:12:14] have a right to invest their money they have a right to invest their money badly I think

[00:12:18] people sort of um I think people sort of um you know I I I

[00:12:21] certainly don't think that it should be outlawed or anything like that um

[00:12:25] but um but I think uh but I think the the

[00:12:29] again I'm just sort of describing I'm describing my own psychology on this but

[00:12:32] but I think this is actually pretty widespread is that um

[00:12:36] is that um there is no wisdom of crowds that when you have a

[00:12:40] lot when you have a large crowd of people doing something

[00:12:43] you should think no nobody's really thought for themselves here okay

[00:12:47] but you wouldn't really hold it against a company if they had 10 investors or 20

[00:12:50] investors in the in their seed round you wouldn't look at it and say

[00:12:54] oh i' I'd hold it a little bit against them

[00:12:58] oh okay I mean how many people here have more than

[00:13:02] 20 investors in their company 20 a lot startups

[00:13:05] are here anyway me see how

[00:13:09] many of you are lottery tickets no I'm kidding um

[00:13:13] there are some out here I'm not going to point at anyone

[00:13:17] but um let's just say there's startups out here and

[00:13:20] a lot of them have received seed funding and I think Duncan had a slide

[00:13:24] about um seed investing is up 10x in the last 60 years

[00:13:28] and but now now it's fiercely competitive to get you know even your post

[00:13:32] seed or your series a and certainly the big series a

[00:13:35] rounds what's your advice to these startups

[00:13:40] on um getting to the series a getting to the series a

[00:13:43] getting the later stage rounds well well one

[00:13:47] one um you know this this can always be pushed

[00:13:51] too far but certainly uh one perspective

[00:13:54] uh that I have is that um you should not think of the financing

[00:13:58] process as that decoupled from everything else and so

[00:14:02] what uh what happens in most companies in Silicon Valley

[00:14:06] is that if things work you know you can always raise money at a later

[00:14:10] stage uh you um you you will and because we

[00:14:14] had this boom you'll typically get an up um

[00:14:17] but um but I think it's um I think it's

[00:14:21] never quite that automatic and so in the companies that

[00:14:24] are doing phenomenally well I think they're often leaving quite a bit of

[00:14:28] money on the table um because they're you know not talking

[00:14:31] enough investors or anything like that and then I think there are a lot at the margins

[00:14:35] where um it's sort of uh it just uh doesn't

[00:14:39] doesn't um it doesn't quite come together at all and so I would say

[00:14:43] you know the day you close your seed round you know like the next

[00:14:46] day you're starting the financing process for the series a

[00:14:50] and you should think about you know what are the benchmarks how do

[00:14:54] we you know and and so first you know so you sort of say well we're starting the financing

[00:14:58] process for series a what can we tell people today

[00:15:02] that's different from yesterday and uh and how do we how do

[00:15:06] we uh how do we go about driving that and um and

[00:15:09] I think I think having that as a you know it shouldn't be

[00:15:13] the soul Focus but having this as a larger Focus than it is is

[00:15:16] probably a good way to to discipline things rather than okay

[00:15:20] I'm glad we're done with the annoying investors we closed the seed money

[00:15:24] now we can work on building the company for a year and then we'll talk

[00:15:27] to people a year from now now and and and and see I think

[00:15:31] uh people would do better if they thought of it as just this continuous process an

[00:15:35] ongoing process const right especially

[00:15:39] Rel especially businesses that are more Capital intensive in one way or another

[00:15:42] right let's turn to your book a little bit and talk about uh

[00:15:47] monopolies monopolies and uh and competition

[00:15:50] and you say and you've said many times um publicly

[00:15:54] that competition is for losers and I would actually

[00:15:59] I actually would agree with that and and I think a number

[00:16:02] of startups would actually agree with that I see a lot

[00:16:06] of startups and I speak to startups every day and we

[00:16:09] talk about what is your you know go to market strategy meaning

[00:16:13] what what Market are you targeting first but at the same time

[00:16:17] in parallel when they're going after this Market they also need to have a

[00:16:20] bigger Vision about you know how big the the opportunity

[00:16:24] can be and when you were at PayPal you you targeted

[00:16:28] eBay the 20,000 eBay

[00:16:31] uh super sellers um but you had to

[00:16:35] have a bigger Vision that was articulated to

[00:16:38] VCS so I guess my question is do you really think most startups

[00:16:43] don't think this way I think most startups would want to

[00:16:47] really uh find a place that's very

[00:16:51] non-competitive well it's um let me

[00:16:55] um yes so there's a question how how is there anything

[00:16:59] unorthodox about this idea at all that you should aim for Monopoly and so there's obviously

[00:17:03] some degree to which um this is very standard business advice you

[00:17:06] want to have a moot you want to be doing something other people are not doing I do think

[00:17:10] using the the MW is is somewhat helpful people

[00:17:14] um you know and I I do think that uh that um

[00:17:18] that you know if you're a Founder an entrepreneur investor you want a company

[00:17:22] that's going to be a monopoly um and you want it to be

[00:17:25] uh you know so differentiated from the rest of

[00:17:29] the world that you have uh that you have real real pricing power um

[00:17:33] and so I do think that's that's uh very worthwhile as

[00:17:36] as a focus um in practice

[00:17:40] um people uh uh people will

[00:17:44] uh will often fudge on this to some extent so they'll say well

[00:17:47] we're somewhat different and it's somewhat competitive and um

[00:17:51] and and you end up with this the somewhat uh somewhat of a fudged

[00:17:55] answer and uh and from there it's very easy to slide into something

[00:17:59] that's incredibly competitive and so um you know one of the

[00:18:03] reasons one of the reasons people don't are uncomfortable

[00:18:07] with Monopoly is if you have a company that's um that's

[00:18:10] aiming for Monopoly there's no one else doing it and you don't get validation

[00:18:14] from other people if you're doing something that's really competitive

[00:18:18] there are lots of other people doing it and um and that

[00:18:21] ends up being validating even though it's a um it's sort of

[00:18:25] a it may be a dumb idea you know sort of the autobiographical version that's like tell

[00:18:29] is I was you know I was hypert tracked as a kid my you know 8th

[00:18:32] grade Junior High School uh yearbook one of my friends said you know I know you're going to

[00:18:36] get into Stanford in four years I got went got into Stanford four years later went to Stanford

[00:18:39] I went to Stanford law school good grades ended up at a top

[00:18:43] New York law firm you know from the outside it was a place everybody wanted to

[00:18:47] get in on the inside it was a place everyone wanted to get out you know I left

[00:18:51] um uh after seven months 3 days when I left um one of

[00:18:54] the people down the hall for me said you know I didn't know it was possible to escape from Alcatraz

[00:18:58] and you say well all you have to do is go out the front door and not come back but

[00:19:02] um but people's sense of identity was so wrapped up in

[00:19:05] who they were competing and who they were beating that um

[00:19:09] that uh that's what people thought was valuable that's what they thought was

[00:19:13] uh was meaningful you know there's the Kissinger line on Academia Henry

[00:19:16] Kissinger line that the battles are so ferocious because the stakes are so

[00:19:20] small and you always think well that's just a description of the insanity of professors

[00:19:24] or something but um you know why would that be if the stakes are so small

[00:19:27] why would the battles be so ferocious and um it's not just a

[00:19:31] for definition of insanity it's also just the logic of the situation

[00:19:35] if if you are no different from somebody else the battles will

[00:19:38] be much more ferocious the smaller the differences the more ferocious

[00:19:42] the battles and um and I do think there's this deeply

[00:19:46] psychological thing where we we sort of get attracted to

[00:19:50] uh to this stuff if you want it's mimetic

[00:19:54] it's it's but if you're if you want to compete like crazy you

[00:19:57] should open a restaurant in San Francisco and you You' say well

[00:20:01] obviously that's such a dumb idea um and obviously therefore nobody's

[00:20:05] opening restaurants in San Francisco and um and that's not quite

[00:20:08] true and what instead happens is people open restaurants

[00:20:12] and they tell a fictional story of why it's not really competitive

[00:20:16] and so it's okay this will be the only British nepales Fusion cuisine

[00:20:20] in the marina um and it's going to be um it's

[00:20:23] going to be uh nice but not too expensive and

[00:20:27] it'll be really hip um Peter one second didn't you open

[00:20:30] up a restaurant once I I I learned a lot from that but

[00:20:34] um but um but I think I think so I think there's

[00:20:38] always a fictional story on this and so so um so

[00:20:41] yes so um so I I would say the you know

[00:20:45] um the Monopoly theme is you know it's a super important

[00:20:49] starting point it's much easier said than done and so

[00:20:52] there are all these pitfalls where people will have all sorts of fictional stories

[00:20:57] of you know why they differentiated why they're unique like every

[00:21:00] Hollywood movie that gets made it's a fictional story it's

[00:21:04] okay it's it's a you know it's a some hackers

[00:21:08] that are um teaming up to track down the shark that killed

[00:21:12] their friend so it's a combination of Jaws and some hacker movie

[00:21:15] it's never been done before so there's always a fictional account of

[00:21:19] why it's one of a kind the reality is it's just a movie the reality is

[00:21:22] the nepes British Fusion Cuisine Restaurant is just a restaurant

[00:21:26] and so um so I think um parsing through the fiction

[00:21:30] is important now there have been you there' have been important categories where people

[00:21:34] um I think did not do this so the you know the clean tech

[00:21:38] um debacle of the of the last decade um every single

[00:21:41] PowerPoint presentation that you saw it started with

[00:21:45] um you know we are in this giant market it's called Energy it's in the hundreds

[00:21:49] of billions or trillions of dollars and that

[00:21:52] so that certainly suggested okay you're a minnow in a vast ocean um

[00:21:56] doesn't matter whether it's a red ocean or a blue ocean it's always a red ocean

[00:21:59] you don't know you you don't know what else you're up against that's not a

[00:22:03] place you want to be so I think I think um so I think

[00:22:07] you do want to have some story about how you're going after small markets taking

[00:22:10] those over then building out in concentric circles there's always the risk

[00:22:14] of stories fictional but you should try not to lie to yourself you know

[00:22:17] I I agree I don't like when people say things like I'm the Uber of

[00:22:21] this or I'm the arnb of this I try to tell them you need to change your story

[00:22:25] something of somewhere is the nothing of nowhere it's like the Stanford of North Dakota

[00:22:29] exactly the uh but you did mention validation

[00:22:33] and so and here's the challenge for people who have really unique

[00:22:36] ideas um you you have to really change behavior

[00:22:40] when you have something totally new something that nobody

[00:22:44] agrees with you can spend a lot of

[00:22:48] time trying to educate people so my question is

[00:22:51] how do you come up with something very unique

[00:22:55] and not waste money overspend

[00:22:59] um you know trying to educate them well it's look it's certainly

[00:23:03] not sufficient for it to be just some weird outlier

[00:23:06] different idea I mean it's it's always you know it's always

[00:23:10] it's not you know it's not just contrarian or unique it's also that

[00:23:14] it makes sense and or it's true or something something like that and

[00:23:17] and so it is always um you know it's always the the

[00:23:21] combination of these things but yeah I think I think it is um

[00:23:25] it is at least somewhat more difficult for something

[00:23:29] that's uh that's new than for something that is you know

[00:23:32] Stanford of North Dakota very easy to describe what that is

[00:23:36] um and so I I would say again as a as a um you know investor

[00:23:41] entrepreneur um you know people often ask me this question what are

[00:23:45] trends that I see in technology what are things that I see happening I

[00:23:48] always dislike the question because you know I have no idea what the future holds on

[00:23:52] that on that sort of a level but um but I I would say systematically

[00:23:56] that I am skeptical of all trends and so I think every

[00:24:00] single Trend that you can name is overrated um you know

[00:24:04] um you know educational software healthare It software

[00:24:07] SAS really overrated if you hear the words cloud computing

[00:24:11] Big Data machine learning you know you should

[00:24:15] just think fraud you should be running away from that as fast as you possibly

[00:24:18] can and and it's not it's not that there isn't such

[00:24:22] a thing as trying to make sense of lots of data or

[00:24:26] you know uh uh Computing moving into the cloud it's

[00:24:29] when people default to buzzwords like that

[00:24:33] they are um they are um they're sort of putting themselves in these

[00:24:36] broad categories and they're obscuring everything that's

[00:24:40] uh that's truly uh essential and unique and ultimately

[00:24:44] valuable and so I think the I think the the the um

[00:24:47] the the the the undervalued companies um are

[00:24:51] the ones that somehow where the narrative is harder it doesn't easily

[00:24:54] fit into these buzzwords but uh uh

[00:24:58] but then that's the challenge you have as a Founder is to is to figure out some way to articulate

[00:25:02] it what what are you investing in that doesn't fall into

[00:25:05] those buzzword well um

[00:25:09] well I would say that you know I would say that um

[00:25:13] you know all the all

[00:25:16] you need a buzzword no no well well I would say all the

[00:25:20] all the major companies that um we've invested in over the years

[00:25:24] there certainly is a description but it's you know it's it's

[00:25:27] it's uh it's it's uh I don't know it's you know Elon

[00:25:31] SpaceX is a is a rocket you know it's a new rocket company

[00:25:35] but it's it's again it's there's all sorts of reasons you can get to very quickly

[00:25:39] why it is oneof a kind or there are companies where you

[00:25:43] have buzzwords but I'm skeptical of them so you could

[00:25:47] say uh people lump Airbnb in as part

[00:25:50] of the sharing economy but I do you like the sharing economy

[00:25:54] I don't I don't think it's quite the right category you know it's it's no it's

[00:25:57] actually just you know it's it's this it's this um Hotel

[00:26:01] um tourism uh type of a do you like marketplaces

[00:26:05] do you like that is Marketplace is another bad oh that's a really bad buzzword

[00:26:09] platforms be scared of platforms all those things are are bad

[00:26:13] but but but you you do occasionally have companies where

[00:26:17] um they sound like they're just part of a of a category

[00:26:21] um and what's unique is hidden and those can be very valuable so you know there had

[00:26:24] been a lot of social networking sites before Facebook and

[00:26:28] and um and I would say um that the key thing was Facebook was

[00:26:32] actually the first one to crack real identity or there had been a lot of search

[00:26:35] engines before Google and so if you said well I'm not going to invest in a search engine

[00:26:39] because we've had that before that would have been a mistake and what was key was

[00:26:42] uh Google was the first one with u machine powered search with a page rank algorithm

[00:26:46] so so um so I do think um I do think uh

[00:26:50] uh we often um we tend to sort of default

[00:26:54] to these uh buzzword like categories um in

[00:26:58] General you should be very leery of categories but there are occasionally

[00:27:02] uh also great companies that are hidden where they sound like they're in

[00:27:05] a category but they're really not so

[00:27:09] use a a larger bigger descriptive to to you have to

[00:27:13] always you have to think through it every case there's no there's no no

[00:27:16] process shortcut what how much time do we have because

[00:27:20] I want to mention to everyone that um we're going to leave 30 minutes

[00:27:23] for Q&A so the the mics are here so when you're ready

[00:27:27] how much time do we have before q&

[00:27:31] it only three minutes okay and

[00:27:35] then 30 minutes for okay so let's let's move on to Bubbles

[00:27:39] um you say we're not in a bubble because it's a psychosocial phenomenon

[00:27:43] I I agree we're definitely not in the bubble you and I have been around since

[00:27:46] 1999 2000 250 companies going public

[00:27:50] I agree there's no Tech bubble but but um

[00:27:55] do you think that there could be an impending bubble

[00:27:59] in the private sector now that all these wouldbe public

[00:28:02] investors are going into the private markets

[00:28:06] to to realize some of the value that's being captured in the private

[00:28:09] markets private sector um you know

[00:28:13] well I I'll stick with my my my categorical thing that

[00:28:17] uh you only get a bu bubble when the Public's involved and by definition

[00:28:20] The public's not involved in in the private sector it's possible the valuations

[00:28:24] can be higher or lower so you know it could be that valuations

[00:28:28] are you know full or or something like that but

[00:28:31] I I don't think um I think we're we're nowhere near the 99

[00:28:35] 200000 um 2000 insanity and I I would say

[00:28:39] the you know um if you had to say where there is

[00:28:42] a bubble today it's probably it's probably

[00:28:46] government bonds it's fixed income um and

[00:28:50] um and I sort of have this history of the stuff where you know the '90s uh

[00:28:54] the lie was growth rates and cash flows and the bubble was called the new economy

[00:28:58] in the 2000s the LIE centered on the uh risk premium

[00:29:01] of assets and the lie was called the Great moderation

[00:29:05] and by System of elimination the only uh Financial variable

[00:29:09] you can lie about that's left we've lied about growth rates and cash flows

[00:29:12] and risk premum the only lie that's left are the risk-free

[00:29:16] rates which are negative and the the claim that they will stay forever negative

[00:29:20] is called the secular stagnation which I think is is is it

[00:29:23] doesn't sound like a bullish lie but that that's sort of what it is and

[00:29:27] um and so if the main thing that um is is is is weirdly distorted

[00:29:31] in our economy is the minus 2% real interest rates then

[00:29:35] the things you want to be careful of are bonds or bond-like assets so you

[00:29:38] don't want to be in bonds you don't want to be in corporate bonds you don't want to be in

[00:29:42] stocks that look like bonds stocks that have large dividends

[00:29:45] large cash flows that people model um like uh

[00:29:49] like bonds um most of the growth tech stocks are completely

[00:29:53] different so it doesn't matter what the interest rates are you know if you're investing

[00:29:57] in a startup company the only variable that matters is will the growth

[00:30:00] happen I I was actually saying not are we seeing a bubble right

[00:30:04] now in the private markets what I was saying was an impending bubble and do you have fears of

[00:30:08] that particularly with the jobs act opening up the private markets to

[00:30:12] the masses you it's it's I the um I don't think that much money

[00:30:15] is flowing over still at the margin so it's it's it's if you look at

[00:30:19] the amount of money going to venture capital firm funds you know it's

[00:30:22] it's still not that much more than it was a few years ago there's definitely some

[00:30:26] crossover investing by f and people like that at very late stages

[00:30:30] on the other hand companies are staying private for much longer and so there is probably more need

[00:30:34] for for private Capital uh there may be a little bit more at the seed stage

[00:30:38] there may be a little bit more at the very late stage but um but I think

[00:30:41] it's um it's sort of one of the last places money is going to

[00:30:45] you know I think there are I think there are very few you know even if you look

[00:30:49] at um people who U made a lot of money at these

[00:30:52] tech companies like Google or Facebook um

[00:30:56] almost none of them are spending most of their money on Tech investing I

[00:31:00] most of the money is being spent on houses MH so so

[00:31:03] um it's it's still the case that if you made you know if you made

[00:31:07] um if you made $10 million at Facebook

[00:31:11] um um I haven't again I haven't done a scientific study

[00:31:15] on this but I would guess that 90% of the people who've made

[00:31:19] that sort of money way more is being spent on a house than on

[00:31:22] investing in seed stage startups and so we should be

[00:31:26] much more worried is there you know a mini housing bubble

[00:31:29] in Silicon Valley then are is too much money being

[00:31:33] spent on um an early stage startups no one's going

[00:31:36] to go broke because they put all their money in seed uh investing

[00:31:40] in startups because no one's doing that yeah I mean I mean

[00:31:44] like is is anybody in this room investing 100% of their

[00:31:47] capital in seed stage

[00:31:51] companies they can't live in these companies

[00:31:55] all we have one person

[00:31:58] okay I stand slightly corrected okay there's one company that you I do

[00:32:02] think you think is a bubble at least bubble valuation so that's Uber

[00:32:06] I'm I'm assuming so um and now I think it's going to be valued

[00:32:10] at $40 billion but I'm not going to ask you whether it's overvalued or

[00:32:14] not because you've said you think it's overvalued I'm going to ask you about the logic

[00:32:17] around why it is and you've said that it's because of

[00:32:21] eroding profits it's competing a lot with Lyft um but yet

[00:32:24] at the same time you use the same logic um

[00:32:28] with Airbnb which I believe does

[00:32:32] have a competitor in homeway in fact homeway probably does I

[00:32:35] think it's going to generate about 400 million in Revenue this year which is still

[00:32:39] maybe more than Airbnb I I don't know but

[00:32:42] by using that same logic then I would wouldn't you say Airbnb

[00:32:46] is also overvalued um yeah so full

[00:32:50] disclosure I'm you know extremely biased on this question since we're investors

[00:32:53] in Lyft and um and so we uh we you know I'm on record

[00:32:57] at say saying that I think Uber is the most ethically challenged company in Silicon Valley

[00:33:01] and I'm I'm willing to repeat that every single time I I'm at one

[00:33:04] of these events um but I but if

[00:33:08] you um let's let's just drill down on the uh let's drill down on say

[00:33:11] Uber versus Airbnb as a as a um as

[00:33:15] an analysis and so uh the question is and I think

[00:33:19] it's always a granular question so you know yes there's this big big market

[00:33:22] for cars there's this big market for you know short-term places

[00:33:26] to to stay um but I think you always have to look at it on a more

[00:33:30] granular basis and so if you have a company

[00:33:34] like uber with 500 cars in San Francisco competing

[00:33:38] with a company like Lyft with 50 cars um that's

[00:33:41] sort of one Dynamic now let's say you have a company like Airbnb

[00:33:45] with 500 places to stay in San Francisco competing

[00:33:49] with the second one with 50 and it's not really homeway because homeway is more vacation home

[00:33:53] so there's a urban versus non-urban thing so I think um

[00:33:56] there's not even a second one that has 50 homes in San Francisco that you could you could

[00:34:00] go to but um but what's very different is cars

[00:34:04] are basically interchangeable places to stay are not so okay so I'd like

[00:34:07] to stay in San Francisco I'd like to stay somewhere in the marina

[00:34:11] that's not 500 that's 25 places are in the marina then

[00:34:14] I have a certain price range I'm down to 10 then I want a place that

[00:34:18] lets me have a dog I'm down to one okay so the

[00:34:21] 500 um uh the one that has 500

[00:34:25] homes um will have a unique value proposition and then you're

[00:34:29] not even going to go to the site with 50 on it because chances

[00:34:32] are there will not be a place in your price range that will allow you to have a dog for

[00:34:36] a week in the marina now um with if you compare

[00:34:40] that with something like uber versus lft it's all just cars

[00:34:44] and um and people you know arguably don't care that much about

[00:34:48] one car versus another and so I would I I would say that

[00:34:52] the uh the competitive Dynamics are are way more intense and so

[00:34:56] so if if you um if you ask me you know if it was a long short

[00:34:59] trade Airbnb at 13 billion versus Uber

[00:35:03] at 40 billion uh I would think it's really clear you want

[00:35:06] to be long Airbnb short uh short Uber probably

[00:35:10] you probably would want to do that even if they were valued equally but I think there's a

[00:35:14] massive relative misvaluation um I'm again tempted to

[00:35:18] come with psychological explanations for this the uh the um

[00:35:21] the most uh you know one sort of standard psychological

[00:35:25] blind spot investors have is that they like things that

[00:35:29] they themselves use and so investors will be biased towards Uber

[00:35:32] because they like driving black Town Cars they're going to be biased against Airbnb

[00:35:37] because uh you don't like uh sleeping on people's couches

[00:35:41] all right well I'm not going to belabor this but but one point so lift though is

[00:35:45] definitely undervalued in your in your book

[00:35:48] um it's it's C certainly um certainly relative to

[00:35:52] uh you know I'm not going to comment on that precisely but I think relative to uh

[00:35:56] yeah it's it's um the the relative share relative to Uber you

[00:36:00] have to assume it's going to get wiped out it's not clear it's going to happen I want to move into the education

[00:36:03] bubble but really quickly I want to just your quick

[00:36:07] thoughts on LinkedIn and Twitter both have a valuation of 28

[00:36:10] billion which company will hit 50 billion first

[00:36:15] you know I'm I don't have as I don't as

[00:36:19] have as good a view on the uh on these uh on

[00:36:22] these um on these sort of much better established public market companies

[00:36:26] there's there's a degree to which you know an awful lot of information is in the

[00:36:30] um is in the uh in the public um markets

[00:36:33] uh you know I got uh one of the things I got in a lot of trouble on this book Tour on they're always

[00:36:37] trying to sort of get you to say controversial things so I was on the CNBC

[00:36:41] program for about three hours in the morning it was a squawkbox show in

[00:36:45] New York and towards the end of the show we were sort of talking about Twitter and

[00:36:48] um um they sort of got on me yeah you know um

[00:36:52] um yeah there's probably a lot of pot smoking go going on over there um

[00:36:56] you know as I as I left the TV studio the CEO of CNBC

[00:37:00] came up was smiling was like you did a great job Peter we'd

[00:37:04] love to have you back anytime you want to be back here wow I got

[00:37:07] really said too much um uh D Costo

[00:37:11] tweeted uh back and in very good form that you know uh

[00:37:15] that um he had no time to comment on it since he was busy eating a large bag of

[00:37:19] Doritos um um and but now

[00:37:23] again you know these things always get taken out of context so let me the larger

[00:37:26] context on Twitter it was a it was a pro Twitter comment yes

[00:37:30] um and the the the the the the larger context was

[00:37:34] that um Twitter um you know that

[00:37:38] you know if you have a monopoly if you have a company that's doing something that nobody else can

[00:37:41] copy you can screw up everything else it can be horribly

[00:37:45] mismanaged um you could even have a lot of pot smoking going on it

[00:37:49] doesn't actually matter um and so um

[00:37:52] and so I think that if I had a sort of so it's a bit of an apples and oranges

[00:37:56] comparison I think link is much better than manag than Twitter um

[00:38:00] um and so it's it's fun the fundamental question on Twitter is you

[00:38:04] do they get their act together but they have a there's a huge franchise value there

[00:38:08] does dick know that you think that LinkedIn is better managed well

[00:38:12] I'm I'm on record is saying that I think I think Twitter is better managed now than it was

[00:38:16] a few years ago but uh but yeah I think it's uh it's

[00:38:19] I think I think a lot of look I think one of the down there's something about

[00:38:23] software where has led to a lot of Monopoly like businesses

[00:38:27] this is why software has been such a good place to invest this is why many other

[00:38:31] areas of Technology have not been good places to

[00:38:35] invest because they don't naturally lead to to monopolies you could invest in dis Drive

[00:38:38] Manufacturing in the 1980s you come with a disc drive that was better than anybody

[00:38:42] else in the world and you and 18 months later someone else would come up with a

[00:38:45] better one and uh 10 years later dis drives were

[00:38:49] massively improved but the net net of it was none of the founders

[00:38:53] investors entrepreneurs involved in dis Drive manufacturing companies made

[00:38:57] money money it was a public good but it was not it was not a good investment

[00:39:00] software is a very unusual category because it's one where the inventors

[00:39:04] have actually captured some of the value of what they create I mean the

[00:39:08] history of innovation for the last 250 years is that most of the time

[00:39:11] the inventors the creators the founders of these companies end up with almost

[00:39:15] nothing um and uh and and so there is something really unusual

[00:39:19] about about software the the sort of the the downside or the

[00:39:23] the one one minus to it is that um is that you

[00:39:27] know in Silicon Valley we have um the companies are generally

[00:39:30] not well-run um and they're you know if you had to sort of rank how well

[00:39:34] these companies are managed it's somewhere from really bad to

[00:39:37] sort of maybe a little bit above mediocre on some absolute

[00:39:41] on some absolute spectrum and it um it doesn't matter that much

[00:39:45] because the business models work as well as they do

[00:39:48] if you're if you're you know the restaurants in San Francisco the management is from

[00:39:52] mediocre to outstanding you have I mean if you're running a restaurant you have

[00:39:56] to do everything just about perfectly and maybe you get to

[00:39:59] stay in business maybe there's something to be said about

[00:40:03] competition it's they're competing and so they're getting to be

[00:40:07] better managers when whenever you compete you get better at that which you're competing on

[00:40:11] and so it yes they um they're operationally uh far more

[00:40:15] efficient um but they made the uh the big mistake of going into the

[00:40:18] wrong thing so there's a lot of stuff you have retail sanity whale Madness the retail

[00:40:22] the details they get right the big picture opening a restaurant catastrophic

[00:40:26] mistake you touched on Innovation

[00:40:30] and so I definitely want to talk about technological stagnation because

[00:40:34] youve you've mentioned that before that over the last 45 years that's that's

[00:40:37] basically what we're seeing technological stagnation but but just

[00:40:41] you know I want to First finish our conversation

[00:40:45] about Bubbles and and by the way does anyone have a question for him

[00:40:49] I don't want to monopolize this conversation

[00:40:53] okay oh go ahead

[00:40:57] question is is working yeah my question is regarding

[00:41:01] the the idea of monopolies so normally historically

[00:41:04] monopolies were dour monopolies it was like some sort of government granted

[00:41:08] license whereas historically in Tech someone's been able to create

[00:41:12] a platform they've rode that way for about say 5 10 years

[00:41:15] create an ecosystem around it and then something very disruptive comes

[00:41:19] out H often times at the peak of what seems like market

[00:41:23] dominance and then a couple years later either those companies are

[00:41:26] history they're they're uh fatally wound

[00:41:30] wounded and so how does that play with the idea so like

[00:41:34] big blue when you know the Anti-Trust authorities went after big

[00:41:38] blue is actually in secular decline I would argue that Google right now is in

[00:41:41] trouble with the uh with the increase in Mobile and people searching

[00:41:45] less and all the apps are siloed so it seems like it's the

[00:41:48] market peak of of Google but I would argue that it's in secular

[00:41:52] decline at least in markets where mobile has really taken off

[00:41:56] uh and then then of course there are contestable markets I mean it's a browser search

[00:42:00] away there's other search engines like Yandex who are

[00:42:04] just waiting for Google to have a hiccup or two

[00:42:08] uh release a wrong algorithm and then you know right now Mighty

[00:42:11] Google can just disappear like no did or Blackberry did

[00:42:16] what are your thoughts there so like I think they're their market

[00:42:19] dominance right now but they're only as dominant till someone in a garage

[00:42:23] or some other company pivots and they could be history in a couple years

[00:42:27] yes so I I don't think um yes I don't think the monopolies in general

[00:42:31] are permanent so as long as there's continuous innovation and Technology

[00:42:35] there is always a risk that the Monopoly gets replaced or

[00:42:39] loses power over time um certainly as a so as a

[00:42:43] so it would be unrealistic to to say I'm only going to invest in companies

[00:42:47] that have permanent monopolies uh because I I I agree with

[00:42:50] you that I think those don't exist I think if you have a 10 or 20

[00:42:54] or 30y year run that's still pretty good now I think most

[00:42:58] most of the time uh most of the companies that you look at

[00:43:01] they go straight to the restaurant and so where it's it's

[00:43:05] like there's no Monopoly ever you never make money and you just lose the money

[00:43:09] pretty quickly um and so much rather invest in a

[00:43:12] in a Google than that even if even if it's not uh something

[00:43:16] something uh something permanent I also agree with you that the uh that I

[00:43:20] think the government Regulators have typically gotten it wrong

[00:43:24] where the antitrust concerns seem to R rise at the

[00:43:28] precise moment where the monopo is naturally starting to fade

[00:43:32] which was certainly true with IBM in the late '70s where things were shifting

[00:43:35] uh uh to software um and I I think this

[00:43:39] was also true of Microsoft in the late 90s where things were shifting to the internet

[00:43:42] I you can argue that because I there different causal stories people can tell but I think I

[00:43:46] think it would have happened even had there been no antitrust action against

[00:43:50] Microsoft and um and so even though I'm I'm somewhat

[00:43:53] agnostic on where Google is on this on the cycle if I had to

[00:43:57] if I had to make the anti-google argument um it would be that

[00:44:00] uh the European antitrust Regulators are starting to move pretty

[00:44:04] hard against Google and since the government always seems to time it incorrectly

[00:44:09] I would take that as evidence that uh that it's actually just at the point

[00:44:12] where the Monopoly starting to fade as a follow on do you think a

[00:44:16] paranoid entrepreneur founder is

[00:44:20] the best determinant of some of these companies that succeed like Facebook

[00:44:24] I see the purchase of WhatsApp and in as both

[00:44:27] defensive moves one was for photographs where they could

[00:44:31] potentially build a social network around photographs so might as well partner up

[00:44:35] with Instagram and absorb it WhatsApp there's been

[00:44:39] evidence in especially Asia and other markets where they've turned it into a

[00:44:42] social network and actually a platform for even like ordering your Uber

[00:44:46] and other goods and services yeah I can't I'm on the board

[00:44:49] of Facebook so I can't I'd be careful about what I what I say there I I

[00:44:53] would say I would say the founders do set a lot of the characters

[00:44:57] these companies over time um and uh and so uh

[00:45:01] and so I don't think um so I do think that

[00:45:05] you know I think the um there there are pluses and minuses

[00:45:08] uh with Founders versus professional CEOs the founders tend to be more difficult personalities

[00:45:12] that tend to be somewhat more extreme uh I think it is better if

[00:45:16] you need to innovate um it's it's it's probably okay to have a professional

[00:45:20] CEO once um you're just um you know turning the crank

[00:45:23] on something um you know uh the um I I think apple

[00:45:27] is the classic sort of founder Le uh company

[00:45:31] where you know the 1985 when they replaced jobs with Scully

[00:45:35] uh the the internal view was home computers were uh were

[00:45:38] finished there was going to be no more Innovation home computers it was just like selling Pepsi

[00:45:43] the the form factor was fully done it was just a marketing play

[00:45:46] um and I think that was um you know I think that was a big that

[00:45:50] was a big uh mistake in retrospect you went through five professional CEOs

[00:45:54] and then finally jobs comes back in '97 and then reinvents the business from home

[00:45:58] computers to uh to consumer electronics um you know

[00:46:01] the the uh but then there may be points where it's very different so you

[00:46:05] could say that uh 2011 when when jobs

[00:46:09] passes away at Apple um you know certainly the uh the

[00:46:12] pessimistic version would have been wow apple is finished there's going to be

[00:46:16] no more Innovation at all um and um and

[00:46:19] it's actually done extremely well the last three and a half years

[00:46:23] and sort of one you know one contrarian cut I would have on it is is perhap

[00:46:26] perhaps um perhaps um um the form factor

[00:46:30] for smartphones in 2011

[00:46:34] um is actually where uh people thought

[00:46:38] the form factor for home computers was in 1985 maybe

[00:46:41] it's largely done and therefore if you have a lead

[00:46:45] in terms of brand or certain economies of scale um that can

[00:46:48] actually be maintained and scaled and um and

[00:46:52] uh and so uh it sort of gets misdiagnosed in all these ways

[00:46:57] um so with the talk of a bubble uh and it just seems like there's

[00:47:01] fear and uncertainty around that do you think that it's a that it's

[00:47:05] more appropriate to categorize that as

[00:47:08] fear and uncertainty um about the unsustainability

[00:47:12] of the current like the current state of either

[00:47:16] valuations or Investments I mean you've spoken out essentially against the

[00:47:20] shotgun model um do you feel like

[00:47:24] people are getting the sense that things are unsustainable

[00:47:28] in their current model in the current way of financing I mean that's kind

[00:47:31] of part of the conference um or do you think

[00:47:35] that they're really actually worried about a

[00:47:40] bubble yeah it's well there's there's probably a lot of

[00:47:44] I it's hard to generalize in I I suspect there's a lot of General free

[00:47:48] floating anxiety around um and I think it's it's somewhat

[00:47:52] Justified since we've had a whole series of crazy bubbles we had a tech bubble

[00:47:55] in the '90s we had a hous in bubble in the last decade um

[00:47:59] and um and so there is it's a very natural question

[00:48:03] to ask you know are we in another bubble if so where is it

[00:48:06] and then you have a long list of possible candidates where that could be so

[00:48:10] I I actually you know given given the history

[00:48:14] of bubbles over recent decades I I actually do think

[00:48:17] um it's a very reasonable default to say that there is a bubble

[00:48:21] somewhere and um and so it's a cause for some anxiety

[00:48:25] where it is is much more debatable I'll get to you but this is

[00:48:29] such a good segue thank you for bringing up bubbles by the way

[00:48:32] so speaking of bubbles the education system is a bubble

[00:48:36] and Peter if you haven't read has likened it to the Catholic Church

[00:48:40] Circa 1500s because it's quote becoming a very

[00:48:43] corrupt institution leading people to believe that salvation

[00:48:47] involves getting a college diploma and so the similarity here

[00:48:51] is that it's it's corrupt and a Reformation is coming so many of us know

[00:48:55] what the Reformation was all about it was the split between

[00:48:59] the Catholic church and the Protestant Church Protestant

[00:49:02] worldview so but that Schism was driven largely by

[00:49:06] one man Martin Luther so I've already mentioned

[00:49:10] this to Peter before teed him up because I want to know who is Martin Luther

[00:49:14] today who will drive this change and burst this education bubble

[00:49:18] yeah I don't I I don't actually know if it's like

[00:49:22] I I don't want to push the analogy that that far you know I um

[00:49:26] I think I think that uh I think I I

[00:49:30] would say the um the the main points of the analogies

[00:49:33] yet you know it's um you know it's it's it's a uniform unitary

[00:49:38] institution uh you know um you get a diploma or

[00:49:41] you get a degree from college or you go to hell you know um there

[00:49:45] sort of all these analogies the costs keep going up there's a certain amount of corruption

[00:49:49] um what I what I do think what I find very implausible

[00:49:53] is the idea that there's any reform from within you maybe

[00:49:57] that happens you know a long time from now you know

[00:50:01] um but I think um I think uh when institutions

[00:50:04] get to a certain point of corruption where you you have a trillion dollars of student

[00:50:08] loans that to a first approximation have paid for a trillion dollars

[00:50:12] worth of lies about how good education is um

[00:50:15] you're dealing with incredibly corrupt institutions at the core

[00:50:19] um this is by the way one of the reasons I'm actually somewhat skeptical of a

[00:50:23] lot of the um education software companies people are

[00:50:27] trying to build because um they're predicated

[00:50:30] on working with these institutions and so um

[00:50:34] and so you know whenever you have something that's a little bit broken you

[00:50:38] can Envision building something that works that fixes it

[00:50:41] that improves things when things are incredibly broken

[00:50:45] um you know it's uh it's very ambiguous it could be mean that there's

[00:50:49] room for massive Improvement but it could also mean that there's just

[00:50:52] massive resistance to uh to any any sort of change and so I think

[00:50:56] I think the fundamental analogy I would say is that um you know the

[00:51:00] the um the uh the um the reform will come from outside

[00:51:04] the system and um and the the message that

[00:51:08] you know and then the question people always have is well what does

[00:51:11] the next education system look like what will what will it be

[00:51:15] and and I think um like um

[00:51:18] like what happened with the Catholic Church post 1500 I think it will not be

[00:51:22] unitary so I don't think there is going to be a single new

[00:51:25] Institution that will replace it and this is this is of

[00:51:29] course was the disturbing message of the in the 16th century was

[00:51:33] um the institution wasn't going to save you you had to figure out how to save

[00:51:36] yourself and in a similar way there's no educational institution

[00:51:41] that will uh that will save you um young people have to figure it out on their

[00:51:44] own and that is the last thing anybody wants to hear accelerators and incubators

[00:51:48] sometimes often liken themselves to the universities there's Draper University

[00:51:52] for entrepreneurs how do they fit in the landscape well I think I

[00:51:55] think I think the future will have many different approaches so I think

[00:51:59] yeah I think it'll be much more heterogeneous and so I think all these things are

[00:52:03] are some of some of the some of the ways that you know you're have you're going to have code academy you're

[00:52:07] going to have to find accelerated ways to learn skills that actually matter there's going to

[00:52:10] be all sorts of stuff like this I think do we have one

[00:52:14] oh go ahead hi so my name is Emily B I'm

[00:52:17] a startup founder and I wanted to ask you a question about the buzzwords

[00:52:22] um you talked about avoiding them running and I I totally agree

[00:52:26] and as a a founder of a company that struggles to find a buzz word I fit into

[00:52:29] I'm wondering how you find companies that have a more difficult narrative to

[00:52:33] tell um and what advice you'd give to people most of the

[00:52:37] things that are out there are really great if you fit nicely into one of these

[00:52:40] Buzz categories but how do you reach out how do you find the people if you don't

[00:52:44] have that simple narrative so I

[00:52:48] I um let me flip this around I I wasn't you know

[00:52:52] you know I I think it's at the end of the day it's primarily not about the narrative it's

[00:52:56] primarily about what is it that you're substantively doing now if

[00:53:00] what it is that you're subst substantively doing can easily fit into

[00:53:03] a buzzword like narrative chances are that it's poorly

[00:53:07] differentiated and so even though it's easy to tell your story

[00:53:11] it's likely to be a bad investment or you know ultimately

[00:53:15] not that successful as a company um and so so I

[00:53:18] think the I think what you want to always have is something that's

[00:53:22] substantively differentiated and then it is admittedly

[00:53:25] you know a challenge to figure out how to um you know explain it to people

[00:53:29] and how to get the narrative right but uh but still you know 80%

[00:53:33] of it is getting the substantive part right and then

[00:53:37] the hope is that you know there would be some way to come up with you know

[00:53:40] with with with a narrative that works

[00:53:44] I was surprised to hear you be somewhat dismissive of sasses and

[00:53:48] the reason I thought is we've seen I've seen I'm uh I'm Peter cow and I'm an

[00:53:52] investor and adviser to a number of companies and I'm very excited by what I'm seeing kind

[00:53:55] of as a Renaissance today of a lot of SAS applications and capabilities

[00:54:00] that are enabling companies to start by Outsourcing non-key

[00:54:03] issues get started up and running and a lot of these sasses then

[00:54:07] as they evolve and people use them they're using them at more and more levels

[00:54:10] that in a sense become more dependent on them and they're paying a recurring

[00:54:14] fee which is attracted to the company and further enabling talented

[00:54:18] people with one or two key skills to grow more so I'm seeing as an integral

[00:54:22] part of what's growing and the right sort of companies to have the

[00:54:25] skills or capabilities to enable people to grow

[00:54:29] what's your reservation about sasses not as a whole group but aren't

[00:54:32] there some terrific ones well it's uh so it's again it's

[00:54:36] it's again was more on the level of the the rhetoric so if someone describes

[00:54:40] it just as a SAS business that's caused

[00:54:43] for that that's that sounds like a buzzword that's caused for skepticism

[00:54:47] and then there's always a granular question you know is this a unique vertical

[00:54:51] that no one else has gone after um you know the

[00:54:55] uh proba the more vertical part of SAS is better than the horizontal

[00:54:59] part because you know the horizontal part has this more fungible

[00:55:03] sense the ver there probably are a number of interesting verticals that people

[00:55:07] have um have not yet done but I think uh again I think

[00:55:11] uh the the um the true narrative the true account of those

[00:55:15] companies is not you know it's this SAS company it's it's actually

[00:55:18] you know it's the software that's for this one very

[00:55:22] specific application and then I would try to tell the story in those terms

[00:55:26] rather than in terms of this abstract SAS category

[00:55:30] one I think one last one great

[00:55:34] r t founder of playful B uh we playful B believe that

[00:55:37] learning starts at Birth our contrarian view is all the all the money

[00:55:41] right now and Ed teex going into K through 12 those existing institutions

[00:55:45] you talk about whereas the most important time is 0 to 5 what do you think

[00:55:49] we should be doing for our 0 to 5y olds to prepare them for the future

[00:55:54] World um let's see

[00:55:57] well uh there's there's probably there's probably a lot that um

[00:56:01] that one could do I I um

[00:56:05] there a lot of different thoughts on the education side I I would say one of the challenges

[00:56:09] for 0 to 5 or K through 12 is that it's

[00:56:13] all distorted because people are not being prepared for the future

[00:56:17] world they're being prepared for college and so

[00:56:20] um so 0 to5 um the Temptation would be you take

[00:56:24] your bearings for helping people get into kindergarten helping the kids get

[00:56:27] into kindergarten um you know K through 12 um

[00:56:31] you're evaluated by whether you're able to get into the right colleges

[00:56:35] um and that's probably you know that's probably the single

[00:56:38] biggest Distortion I I don't know you know how easy

[00:56:42] it is to fix that because um because that is in

[00:56:46] fact still where the mindset is you the education bubble isn't going to end anytime

[00:56:49] soon because people are too scared they have they don't see any alternatives

[00:56:53] or anything like this I I would say one um one General thing

[00:56:57] to say about um you know one of one of the things that makes

[00:57:00] education a bubble and one of the things that's characteristic of many of these bubbles is they involve

[00:57:04] incredible abstractions and so education itself is an abstraction

[00:57:08] and so it's worth asking um you know is education

[00:57:12] is it an investment where you're investing in the future

[00:57:15] is it a consumption decision where it's um for your party in college

[00:57:19] or it's just a fun game you're playing um is it

[00:57:23] um is it an insurance policy to avoid falling through

[00:57:27] the really big cracks in our society or is it a tournament

[00:57:30] a zero sum tournament where you're trying to beat everybody else

[00:57:34] um and uh and I think it's you know so it's sort of worth

[00:57:38] thinking about uh even though these are still somewhat abstract categories

[00:57:42] I think it's helpful to always think of you know is your company is it

[00:57:46] is it is it an investment consumption insurance policy

[00:57:50] or tournament company as far as education goes and then

[00:57:53] how do you frame it within those so I I I I'd start by

[00:57:57] parsing it into those four subcategories

[00:58:01] okay I have so many more questions but obviously we can't keep going on

[00:58:05] unforunately it's Lun time I mean Peter we could go on for hours I'm sure

[00:58:09] but remember book signing we have uh we have 200 books

[00:58:12] and I'm sure Peter's going to uh we twist his arm to sign a couple for us

[00:58:16] I appreciate your time and I I must say uh it's a real pleasure to have him

[00:58:20] here and to end the question on a Education topic Peter really is

[00:58:23] one of the most important thinkers I think in the United States on this education

[00:58:27] problem I mean everything with Facebook and all the money he's made is great but his thinking on

[00:58:31] education is just really really spectacular I appreciate your time

[00:58:34] he is the Martin Luther yeah that he he didn't take the

[00:58:38] [Applause]

[00:58:53] bit
