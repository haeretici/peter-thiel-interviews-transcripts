[Peter Thiel on Stagnation, Innovation, and What Not To Name Your Company | Conversations with Tyler](https://youtu.be/i_yJTCDU4uE)

[00:00:03] CARRIE CONKO: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today.

[00:00:07] My name is Carrie Conko. I am senior vice president at the Mercatus Center here at George Mason University.

[00:00:14] It’s my pleasure, on behalf of the Mercatus Center, to welcome you to the first of a series

[00:00:20] of conversations with Tyler. Today’s special guest is Peter Thiel.

[00:00:26] The Mercatus Center is the leading university-based source of market-oriented ideas.

[00:00:33] Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems, bringing scholarly

[00:00:40] research to bear on the most pressing issues facing our country today.

[00:00:46] This series of conversations will bring together world-class leaders who will talk about how

[00:00:52] ideas, cutting-edge research, and applied economics can be used to fix the problems

[00:00:59] we face in society. I’d like to take a moment to thank the members of the media relations team and the event

[00:01:08] strategies team, who have made today’s event possible.

[00:01:12] I’d also like to thank Tyler Cowen, whose vision guides not only the Mercatus Center,

[00:01:17] but this series of events. It’s my pleasure to get to introduce Tyler today.

[00:01:24] Tyler Cowen is the Holbert L. Harris Professor of Economics at George Mason University.

[00:01:31] With his colleague at George Mason, Alex Tabarrok, he is the cofounder of the popular economics

[00:01:39] blog Marginal Revolution. He is also cofounder of Marginal Revolution University, an innovative space for learning

[00:01:49] and teaching economics online. Bloomberg called Tyler “America’s hottest economist.”

[00:01:57] Foreign Policy has named him to the Global Top 100 Thinkers.

[00:02:02] The Economist named him as one of the most influential economists of the past decade.

[00:02:08] For those of us who have had an opportunity to have a conversation with Tyler, we know

[00:02:13] that his mind is an ever-changing kaleidoscope. We can discuss the NBA, arts, music, literature, even economics, and sometimes public policy.

[00:02:26] I’m really pleased to share him with you today.

[00:02:30] And with that, Tyler, I’d like to invite you to start the conversation.

[00:02:38] TYLER COWEN: Just a minute on the premise of this series.

[00:02:46] It’s been my view for years now that Peter Thiel is one of the greatest and most important

[00:02:52] public intellectuals of our entire time. Throughout the course of history, he will be recognized as such.

[00:02:58] I thought Peter would be absolutely the perfect person to inaugurate this series.

[00:03:04] Peter himself doesn’t need an introduction; he has a best-selling book. His role in PayPal, Facebook, Palantir, many other companies, is well known.

[00:03:12] Peter is a dynamo. There is no one like Peter. But the purpose today is to focus on Peter’s views as a public intellectual.

[00:03:20] The way we run these dialogues are a bit different than usual. It’s not going to be chatty and drawn out.

[00:03:26] We’ll try to replicate a kind of conversation Peter and I would have with each other.

[00:03:30] Get right to the point, a lot of quick back and forth, and we’ll see how well we can

[00:03:35] do that in public. But I’ve watched a lot of interviews with Peter online and we’re going to try to make

[00:03:39] this different from all those. Let’s start with some questions about stagnation, Peter.

[00:03:44] At any point, if you care to add other topics of your own, please do so.

[00:03:48] You’re well known for arguing, well, “they promised us flying cars and all we got is

[00:03:53] 140 characters”; “technological progress has slowed down.”

[00:03:56] How is it you think that we’re most likely to get out of the great stagnation, when that

[00:04:00] happens? PETER THIEL: Yes, I think there are, those three separate things.

[00:04:05] There’s the question of stagnation, which I think has been a story of stagnation in

[00:04:09] the world of atoms, not bits. I think we’ve had a lot of innovation in computers, information technology, Internet,

[00:04:14] mobile Internet in the world of bits. Not so much in the world of atoms, supersonic travel, space travel, new forms of energy,

[00:04:22] new forms of medicine, new medical devices, etc. It’s sort of been this two-track area of innovation.

[00:04:31] There are a lot of questions of what has caused it and I think maybe that’s a good part

[00:04:35] to start in terms of what gets you out of it. On a first cut, I would say that we lived in a world in which bits were unregulated

[00:04:45] and atoms were regulated. If you are starting a computer software company, that costs maybe $100,000, to get a new drug

[00:04:54] through the FDA, maybe on the order of a billion dollars or so.

[00:04:58] If the FDA were regulating video game technologies, and you had to do a double-blind study to

[00:05:04] make sure that the video games weren’t addictive, damaging to your brain, etc.

[00:05:08] These things are very overdetermined. It’s driven by many different factors.

[00:05:13] My narrow attempt to get out of it is not necessarily to come to DC and beg the regulators

[00:05:19] to be more reasonable. It is just to try to find ways for people to succeed at the margins.

[00:05:24] Because I think the other thing that has driven the stagnation is the hysteresis.

[00:05:28] When you have a history of failure, that becomes discouraging and so failure begets failure.

[00:05:34] No halfway sane parent would encourage their kids to study nuclear engineering today, whereas

[00:05:41] there are a lot of people going into software. The history of success in software is encouraging more people to go into it and drive more innovation.

[00:05:48] Then the history of failure in these other areas has been very discouraging.

[00:05:52] What I think would start, if you got some signal successes in other areas, that can

[00:05:58] then set a precedent and you can somehow get what’s been a vicious cycle into a virtuous

[00:06:02] cycle. TYLER COWEN: Then if you have to make a prediction, which breakthrough in particular will get

[00:06:06] us out of the stagnation? What’s your pick?

[00:06:11] PETER THIEL: I still think there are—probably the most natural ones are all these things

[00:06:20] that are at the boundary of information technology on atoms, of bits and atoms.

[00:06:25] TYLER COWEN: Artificial intelligence? Biotech? PETER THIEL: AI feels slightly overhyped.

[00:06:31] Biotech, a lot could happen. It feels heavily regulated.

[00:06:35] But if you’ve got self-driving cars, that would be a significant innovation which would

[00:06:40] change a decent amount at the margins. There’s some regulatory challenges with it, but it’s sort of right at the intersection

[00:06:47] of the kinds of things that could happen. I think the most natural hope is that information technology starts to broaden out and starts

[00:06:54] to impact this world of atoms. Then we’re going to have this question about whether the technology outpaces the politics

[00:07:00] or vice versa. TYLER COWEN: What number should I keep my eye on? Let’s say you’re going to take a long nap and I need someone to tell me, “Tyler,

[00:07:06] we’re out of the great stagnation now.” What’s the impersonal indicator that I should look at?

[00:07:11] PETER THIEL: I disagree with the premise of that question. I don’t think the future is this fixed thing that just exists.

[00:07:17] I don’t think there’s something automatic about the great stagnation ending or not ending.

[00:07:23] I think—I always believe in human agency and so I think it matters a great deal whether

[00:07:28] people end it or not. There was this sort of hyperoptimistic book by Kurzweil, The Singularity Is Near; we had

[00:07:35] all these sort of accelerating charts. I also disagree with that, not just because I’m more pessimistic, but I disagree with

[00:07:42] the vision of the future where all you have to do is sit back, eat popcorn, and watch

[00:07:47] the movie of the future unfold. I think the future is open to us to decide what to do.

[00:07:55] If you take a nap, if you encourage everybody else to take a nap, then the great stagnation

[00:08:00] is never going to end. TYLER COWEN: Is there a chance that intellectually we’ve become so complacent that our worldviews

[00:08:06] have so changed? Some writers have suggested the decline of mainline Protestantism has intellectually

[00:08:11] changed America forever. The sense of what can be accomplished, our unwillingness to repeat, say, the Manhattan

[00:08:17] Project, or Apollo. Is it possible we’re simply in that forever, and it’s a downward spiral and the longer

[00:08:24] you’re in it, the harder it is to get out? It’s not really about bits. PETER THIEL: It’s certainly possible that it’s something like that.

[00:08:33] But I do think that there’s certainly, at the margins, there always are things that

[00:08:39] we can do. I am somewhat pessimistic about the possibility of government being a key, a place where the

[00:08:50] great stagnation gets reversed. There is a sense in which a letter from Einstein to the White House would get lost in the mail

[00:08:56] room today. You could not even do Apollo.

[00:09:00] Even something like the SDI program in the 1980s. The debate in the ’80s was, it’s a dangerous first-strike weapon versus a great defensive

[00:09:08] technology, whereas today, people would say that SDI was just this fictional thing that

[00:09:12] would have never worked. Again, this very odd way that our expectations have been dramatically reduced.

[00:09:19] But I do think there’s sort of a question about where in the private sector can you

[00:09:24] coordinate things on a big enough scale.

[00:09:28] Silicon Valley start-ups have been a way to do it, and maybe there’s some class of somewhat

[00:09:32] larger companies. My PayPal colleague Elon Musk started both SpaceX and Tesla, which are extremely charismatic

[00:09:40] businesses, because it involved somewhat larger-scale complex coordination, getting a lot of different

[00:09:46] pieces together to work. Not as big as we could do, perhaps, if you had a well-functioning government.

[00:09:51] But I think that’s not really that realistic. TYLER COWEN: Given that energy prices are now so low, are you more optimistic about

[00:09:57] peak oil than you used to be, or do you think that’s a temporary blip on the horizon?

[00:10:01] PETER THIEL: I’m surprised by how much they’ve collapsed.

[00:10:06] I would say, they are still higher than they were in 2002, 2003 on the oil side.

[00:10:13] The jury is still very much out on how well it’s going to work. I think the big question is, what’s the equilibrium price at which fracking is really

[00:10:21] going to work? We’ve had something like $450 billion has gone into the fracking industry in the last

[00:10:27] four or five years, and there’s a question whether at $50 a barrel oil, can you actually

[00:10:33] get a positive return on that money? The striking thing, even as of summer 2014, when oil was still at $100-plus a barrel,

[00:10:42] was even though you had these two boom stories: you had the Silicon Valley IT story, and you

[00:10:46] had the fracking, mid-US growth story.

[00:10:52] The striking thing was always how much smaller the fortunes were that were being made in

[00:10:57] the fracking industry, which led me to think that somehow, it was not as great an innovation

[00:11:04] as was happening on the IT side. Or more marginal, harder to get to work.

[00:11:09] I think if it barely worked at $100, it’ll be very interesting to see how it works at

[00:11:14] $50. [Note: The recording was briefly interrupted here.] PETER THIEL: The intellectual question that I ask at the start of my book is, “Tell

[00:11:18] me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.” This is a terrific interview question.

[00:11:22] Even when people can read on the Internet that you’re going to ask this question to

[00:11:26] everybody you interview, they still find it really hard to answer. And it’s hard to answer not because people don’t have any ideas.

[00:11:32] Everyone has ideas. Everyone has things they believe to be true that other people won’t agree with you on.

[00:11:36] But they’re not things you want to say. TYLER COWEN: Peter, tell me something that’s true that everyone agrees with you on. PETER THIEL: Well there are lots of things that are true that everyone agrees with me on.

[00:11:40] I think for example even this idea that the university system is somewhat screwed up and

[00:11:53] somewhat broken at this point. This is not even a heterodox or a very controversial idea anymore.

[00:12:02] There was an article in TechCrunch where the writer starts with “this is going to be super controversial” and then you look through the comments—there were about 350 comments—they

[00:12:09] were about 70 percent in my favor. So the idea that the education system is badly broken is not even controversial.

[00:12:19] You know, the ideas that are really controversial are the ones I don’t even want to tell you.

[00:12:25] I want to be more careful than that. I gave you these halfway, in-between ideas that are a little bit edgier.

[00:12:31] But I will also go a little bit out on a limb: I think the monopoly idea, that the goal of

[00:12:40] every successful business is to have a monopoly, that’s on the border of what I want to say.

[00:12:47] But the really good ideas are way more dangerous than that.

[00:12:50] TYLER COWEN: Let me give you my take on how I’ve tried to fit different parts of your

[00:12:55] thought together. And again, for all you listeners, this doesn’t have to be true. It’s just my mental model of Peter Thiel.

[00:13:00] That you’re one of a lot of thinkers who takes the idea of original sin—it doesn’t

[00:13:06] have to be a theological commitment—seriously. Tocqueville wrote in the 19th century that America eventually would evolve to be a land

[00:13:12] of complacent people who were going to stop believing in original sin and stick to a kind of conformist mediocrity.

[00:13:16] So you have taken this to heart. The world out there is deeply weird.

[00:13:21] Even though there appears to be free entry into ideas production, because of René Girard–like

[00:13:27] ideas, the people who deviate, someone comes down on them pretty hard.

[00:13:32] So there’s excess conformity, the original sin in people’s motives gets magnified at

[00:13:37] the social level. So basically, there are distortions out there. And everything we can see, it’s a gnostic theology, and a relatively small number of

[00:13:46] people who can see through those distortions can be great entrepreneurs, or can tell the

[00:13:51] truth about politics. And it’s all ultimately some kind of bundled, implicitly theological, but not necessarily

[00:13:58] involving belief in God, but theological perspective about the nature of people.

[00:14:02] And it ends up spreading to all the different parts of society and that, to me, has been

[00:14:06] what ties your thought together. But that’s a hypothesis; let’s hear your reaction to that.

[00:14:10] PETER THIEL: Let’s see. I think the way original sin normally works is that it resides in individuals, in one

[00:14:17] way or another. And so theologically, I would place it much more in society.

[00:14:21] And so I think society is both something that’s very real and very powerful, but on the whole

[00:14:29] quite problematic. We always run the risk of losing sight of that.

[00:14:36] I don’t know if it’s strictly the awareness of it that solves it.

[00:14:44] Certainly, there probably are some people who are just vaguely oblivious to it, so in

[00:14:51] Silicon Valley, I point out that many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering

[00:14:55] from a mild form of Asperger’s where it’s like you’re missing the imitation, socialization

[00:15:00] gene. TYLER COWEN: And that’s a plus, right?

[00:15:03] PETER THIEL: It happens to be a plus for innovation, and creating great companies, but I think

[00:15:08] we always should turn this around as an incredible critique of our society.

[00:15:12] We need to ask, what is it about our society where those of us who do not suffer from Asperger’s

[00:15:17] are at some massive disadvantage because we will be talked out of our interesting, original,

[00:15:21] creative ideas before they are even fully formed? We’ll notice that’s a little bit too weird, that’s a little bit too strange.

[00:15:27] Maybe I’ll just go ahead and open the restaurant that I’ve been talking about, that everyone else can understand and agree with, or do something extremely safe and conventional,

[00:15:36] and therefore hypercompetitive, and probably not that great as an idea.

[00:15:42] I’d say a lot of these people may not understand this larger theory about society, but they

[00:15:49] are somewhat oblivious to it, and it pushes progress.

[00:15:52] Now, certainly my own experience would have been a little bit more where—I grew up in

[00:16:03] Northern California. It was this hyper-tracked process, where my eighth grade junior high school yearbook,

[00:16:09] one of my friends wrote in, “I know you’re going to get into Stanford in four years.” Four years later I got into Stanford, then I got into Stanford Law School.

[00:16:16] You won all the conventionally tracked competitions; you ended up at a big law firm in Manhattan.

[00:16:22] From the outside, it was a place where everybody wanted to get in. On the inside, it was a place where everybody wanted to get out.

[00:16:28] You ask one of the people down the hall from me, said that it was great to see me leave.

[00:16:36] I left after seven months and three days, it was great to see me leave. It was like “I had no idea it was possible to escape from Alcatraz.”

[00:16:42] TYLER COWEN: What did you learn there? PETER THIEL: I learned that I was incredibly prone to this problem of social convention.

[00:16:53] If you want to give it a religious terminology, the psychological terminology would be that

[00:16:58] I had a rolling quarter life crisis in my mid-20s. The religious terminology, I had a quasi-conversion experience where I realized the value system

[00:17:07] was deeply corrupt and needed to be questioned. I do think that one of the ways of challenging convention, one way, the Asperger’s way,

[00:17:18] is just to be vaguely oblivious to it all, and continue apace.

[00:17:22] Then I think there is another modality where you just become aware of how conventional

[00:17:27] our conventions really are, and then that becomes sort of an indirect route of trying

[00:17:33] to start thinking for yourself. TYLER COWEN: In your view, perhaps the contemporary world is becoming, I don’t know what the

[00:17:39] word would be, stranger, or weirder, or more shaped by individuals who are different, precisely

[00:17:45] because conformity is being piled on other places. So if the movers and shakers would be people who are in some way neuro diverse, then overall,

[00:17:54] the world is becoming more surprising in a way, right? That’s what we expect at different margins, at different corners.

[00:17:59] This will accumulate. It may not ever feel like we’re getting out of the great stagnation, but each bit

[00:18:05] of change we get is in a way a more different change than we would get, say, in 1957, where

[00:18:11] everything was done with guys with white shirts and starched white collars, hoping they would

[00:18:16] be able to buy a little pocket calculator someday.

[00:18:19] PETER THIEL: I think the innovation that we are getting is driven in strange ways.

[00:18:27] I worry that actually the conformity problem is actually more acute than it was in the

[00:18:33] ’50s or ’60s, so that the category of the eccentric scientist, or even the eccentric

[00:18:38] professor, is a species that is steadily going extinct because there is less space for that

[00:18:47] in our research universities than there used to be.

[00:18:51] I worry that perhaps, if anything, it’s a little bit the other way. It’s very hard to measure these things or calibrate them, but I think that in politics,

[00:19:01] the conventional approach is to simply look at pollsters. What are your positions going to be?

[00:19:06] You just look at the polls, you figure this out, and it works fairly well.

[00:19:13] At the end of the day, that’s probably not how the system really changes. It probably will be changed by some idiosyncratic people who have really strong convictions,

[00:19:21] and are over time, able to convince more people of them.

[00:19:25] But whether this means that we have more or less change is hard to evaluate.

[00:19:30] It always comes from these somewhat nonconventional channels. TYLER COWEN: Let’s say you’re trying to select people for your Thiel fellowships,

[00:19:36] or maybe to work for one of your companies, or to start a new company with.

[00:19:41] Just you, Peter Thiel, as a judge of talent, what trait do you look for in that person

[00:19:46] that is being undervalued by others? The rest of the world out there is way too conformist, so there must then be unexploited

[00:19:53] profit opportunities in finding people. If you’re less conformist, which I’m very willing to believe, indeed would insist on

[00:20:00] that being the case, what is it you look for? PETER THIEL: It’s very difficult to reduce it to any single traits, because a lot of

[00:20:09] what you’re looking for, are these almost Zen-like opposites. You want people who are both really stubborn and really open-minded.

[00:20:17] That’s a little bit contradictory.

[00:20:22] You want people who are idiosyncratic and really different, but then who can work well

[00:20:28] together in teams. And so, this is again, maybe not 180 degrees opposite, but like 175 degrees.

[00:20:35] TYLER COWEN: This is why you like Hegel? PETER THIEL: I don’t like Hegel that much.

[00:20:40] [laughter] PETER THIEL: I think if you focus too much

[00:20:45] on one or the other end of it, you would tend to get it completely wrong.

[00:20:52] I like to get things where you get these combinations of unusual traits, so if you have people with

[00:20:57] some really interesting, very different ideas, that suggests we’re in the idiosyncratic

[00:21:04] category. Then the important question becomes, OK, would they actually be able to function socially

[00:21:09] and execute? Then maybe the teamwork question you’d ask would be, what’s the prehistory of this

[00:21:14] company? How did you meet, how long have you been working together, and if there’s a long prehistory,

[00:21:19] that would be good on the other side. I think it’s always getting these combinations right.

[00:21:22] TYLER COWEN: There’s an interview with you when someone asks, “What’s the Straussian reading of your book, Zero to One?”

[00:21:28] You say something like, “The Straussian reading is don’t be an entrepreneur.” Yet at the same time, society has this problem, which many of us would recognize, that too

[00:21:37] many people go down tracks of conservative career choices.

[00:21:40] You work for a consulting firm, or you go to finance if you come out of a top school.

[00:21:44] It’s now become a new kind of conservative choice, maybe, to go to Silicon Valley in

[00:21:49] certain ways. Given the difficulties of becoming an entrepreneur, and the pull of conformity, how is it actually,

[00:21:56] socially? What kind of intellectual or ideological reconstruction do we need to get people out of so many of

[00:22:01] these conservative career choices? PETER THIEL: It’s hard to say.

[00:22:05] I think “entrepreneur” is one of these very odd terms people will say—where you’ll

[00:22:12] ask somebody, “What do you want to be doing in five, ten years?” “Oh, it’s very clear, I want to be an entrepreneur.”

[00:22:18] It’s just this vague, empty term. It’s like “I want to be rich” or “I want to be famous.”

[00:22:25] I am actually quite skeptical of that as a term, so yes, I think I did say the Straussian

[00:22:31] reading of Zero to One, was that perhaps—I had the adverb in—but perhaps you should

[00:22:37] not be an entrepreneur. It was because on one level, the book is advice about how you would go about building a business,

[00:22:44] but then on some level, you could also read every single chapter as discouraging people

[00:22:50] from going into business potentially as well. If you give the core advice that you should start a business that’s going to be a monopoly,

[00:22:57] and then you say, well that’s really discouraging a lot of people who don’t have an idea for

[00:23:02] a monopoly, so maybe they shouldn’t be starting businesses. My view is we should be starting more good businesses and fewer bad ones.

[00:23:10] Not more businesses in the abstract, not more start-ups in the abstract.

[00:23:14] Yes, there is always this psychosocial bubble question.

[00:23:19] I don’t think we’re in a tech bubble today, like we were in ’99, 2000.

[00:23:24] I actually do not think the public, as a whole, is involved in quite the same way, and so

[00:23:30] I’m not worried about it like I would have been in ’99, 2000. TYLER COWEN: I had some[one] email me a question; let me read it off and tell us what you think.

[00:23:37] This is a quotation. “What do you think a well-educated but zero marginal product worker in his mid-30s should

[00:23:46] do to remake himself for the next 30 years?”

[00:23:49] PETER THIEL: I’m always super hesitant to answer questions that are so abstract.

[00:23:57] If there was some general answer to the question, it would almost certainly be wrong.

[00:24:00] TYLER COWEN: Correct. PETER THIEL: If I give you some general answer, and everybody could follow it, then if everybody

[00:24:04] followed that answer, it would be the wrong thing to do.

[00:24:11] Certainly, there still seems to be strangely a shortage of people in IT, broadly.

[00:24:16] If you’re reasonably talented, you can get training in software and coding in a fairly

[00:24:24] short period of time, and get in an employable job.

[00:24:28] It’s sort of an odd cultural thing in our society where we still think of computer programming

[00:24:34] as such a geeky, bad career choice for people that even after a decade in which it’s worked

[00:24:41] surprisingly well, there probably are still far too few people going into it. I think that’s a safe general one.

[00:24:48] Petroleum engineering, that’s the other amazing one that has not yet attracted more

[00:24:52] people into it, in spite of a decade-long boom.

[00:24:56] TYLER COWEN: If you think of the cultural achievement of mankind, or at least the United

[00:24:59] States, or maybe just your own California, and you asked the question, has that too seen

[00:25:04] a great stagnation, or is artistic creativity still reaching new and higher peaks—what’s

[00:25:10] your view there? Just how general and pervasive is this phenomenon of stagnation?

[00:25:13] If it’s intellectual in its roots, you might think that it’s applying to everything.

[00:25:19] PETER THIEL: I think it’s very hard to measure in a number of these dimensions.

[00:25:24] I think artistic things, things of a very qualitative nature, are hard to measure.

[00:25:28] I certainly think Hollywood is producing fewer great movies relative to 20, 30, 40 years

[00:25:34] ago. On the other hand, there are a lot of good TV shows. TYLER COWEN: What’s your favorite TV show?

[00:25:38] PETER THIEL: It’s all sort of this crazy schlocky stuff like Game of Thrones.

[00:25:43] I don’t watch that much TV, but I think there are a lot of things like this that work.

[00:25:52] It’s hard to measure that. I think the technology and science questions are ones that I find very interesting.

[00:26:00] I think they are somewhat more measurable than a lot of the qualitative social ones.

[00:26:06] I suspect we’re not innovating as much in those dimensions, either, but I think that

[00:26:11] one, you’d just end up projecting your own biases onto society. TYLER COWEN: In the back room, we were talking about Japan, and a recent trip of yours to

[00:26:18] Japan. Maybe you would like to relate some of what you were saying? PETER THIEL: They always want you to say things that are sort of contrarian and surprising,

[00:26:27] and so they asked me at this discussion I was giving in Japan.

[00:26:32] And the answer that I came up with, which was both flattering to the audience, but somewhat

[00:26:38] disturbing from our perspective, was I think we always think of Japan as this hyper-imitative,

[00:26:45] noncreative culture of extreme conformity.

[00:26:49] My suggestion is that perhaps at this point, Japan is the least conformist, the least imitative

[00:26:54] country in the world.

[00:26:58] There’s actually a lot of interesting aesthetic cultural stuff going on, there still is a

[00:27:04] lot of very successful types of businesses. There’s innovation in food production, all sorts of interesting areas.

[00:27:11] But then it’s an indictment of the West, where I think Japan is no longer the Japan

[00:27:16] of the Meiji Restoration of the 1870s, or the Japan of the cheap plastic imitation toys

[00:27:22] of the 1950s. It’s a country that no longer thinks it can get that much by copying the West.

[00:27:29] There’s probably still some narrow interest in IT and software.

[00:27:34] Outside of that, I think they are copying the US and Western Europe less and less.

[00:27:39] People aren’t even learning English that much anymore. They’re speaking less English than they were 15, 20 years ago.

[00:27:44] The golf courses are all getting shut down and converted to solar farms or something;

[00:27:49] people don’t even want to play golf anymore.

[00:27:52] I think we need to take this as a real critique of our society, very seriously, that they’re

[00:27:57] finding less that’s desirable to imitate in the US or Western Europe.

[00:28:01] TYLER COWEN: I’ll name a few items, and you tell me, just if you think this is overrated

[00:28:05] or underrated. John Maynard Keynes, overrated or underrated?

[00:28:11] PETER THIEL: Still massively overrated, but perhaps not as much as he used to be.

[00:28:17] TYLER COWEN: New York City, overrated or underrated? PETER THIEL: That’s massively overrated.

[00:28:23] TYLER COWEN: Why?

[00:28:27] PETER THIEL: We had a 25-year boom in finance, from ’82 to ’07.

[00:28:34] I think that’s slowly ebbing, slowly abating.

[00:28:38] It’s going to be increasingly regulated, and so if you want a long/short blue state

[00:28:44] trade, you want to be long California, short New York.

[00:28:49] The long/short red state trade, by the way, is you want to be long Texas, short Virginia.

[00:28:55] If you ask, what do Virginia and New York have in common, and what do Texas and California

[00:29:00] have in common? Both Texas and California are very inward-focused places.

[00:29:07] California, both the Hollywood version and the Silicon Valley version, are very focused

[00:29:13] in on themselves. Texas is also a very inward-focused place.

[00:29:17] What Virginia and New York, or let’s say DC and New York City, have in common is that

[00:29:22] they’re centers of globalization. Finance is an industry that’s fundamentally leveraged to globalization, and DC is fundamentally

[00:29:29] leveraged to international geopolitics. I would bet on globalization slowly being in abeyance.

[00:29:39] I think with the benefit of hindsight, we will realize that 2007 was not just the peak

[00:29:44] year of the finance boom, but also the peak year of globalization, like maybe 1913.

[00:29:50] Happily, it hasn’t resulted in a world war, at least not yet, but I think we are in this

[00:29:55] period where globalization is steadily pulling back. And so you want to be in places or industries that are levered to things other than globalization.

[00:30:03] TYLER COWEN: I tend to agree with that. As you may know, before 2007, trade is going up at a rate three times higher than world

[00:30:09] GDP. Post the crisis, trade and world GDP are going up at about the same rate.

[00:30:14] I think in rate terms, that has peaked. So you see California and Texas, in a way, as being like Japan.

[00:30:20] You’re long Japan, also, but that’s underrated. PETER THIEL: I’d be relatively long Japan.

[00:30:27] I wouldn’t be long France, but maybe that’s even underrated because it’s probably still

[00:30:31] somewhat antiglobalization, and the marginal tax rates probably will go down in France

[00:30:36] at some point. But yes, I’d be long the things that are not as levered to globalization.

[00:30:42] I would be skeptical of London, New York City, places like that.

[00:30:46] TYLER COWEN: How about China? PETER THIEL: China is hard to evaluate on this globalization metric, because on some

[00:30:56] level, the growth story is linked to exports and globalization.

[00:31:02] Then at the same time, it has these capital controls and all of these ways that it’s

[00:31:07] somewhat separate. I find it always very hard to evaluate.

[00:31:11] I do think it’s interesting that the questions about China are being asked less often in

[00:31:17] the US today than they were a decade ago. In 2005, it was a very widespread question, in what year will China overtake the US?

[00:31:25] A decade later, it’s reasonable to think that it’s a decade closer to when this will

[00:31:30] happen. It’s a much less commonly asked question.

[00:31:34] At the end of the day I suspect we are underestimating China, but it may be very hard to invest.

[00:31:41] I’ve always thought that you could only participate in the Chinese boom if you are

[00:31:46] a well-connected, card-carrying member of the Chinese Communist Party.

[00:31:49] I’m not, and so it’s not been a place that I’ve really focused that much.

[00:31:53] TYLER COWEN: Think of a place like Brazil. I tend to think of Brazil as fairly inward-looking.

[00:31:57] If you’re on a bus in Brazil, you hear Brazilian music typically, not American pop music.

[00:32:04] You think Brazil is underrated, or overrated, economically? Do you agree with my characterization of it is as relatively inward-looking, and if it’s

[00:32:10] an exception, what would account for that? PETER THIEL: It’s relatively inward-looking.

[00:32:16] Actually, one other metric for inward- versus outward-looking is which countries were first

[00:32:21] taken over by Facebook, how Facebook spread all over the world. It started with the US, other English-speaking countries.

[00:32:26] Then it went to all the small European countries where people spoke English: Switzerland, Holland,

[00:32:32] Scandinavian countries. The ones that were the hardest to break into were the ones with the very separate language

[00:32:37] groups. Brazil was much harder than the rest of Latin America, it sort of had this Spain to Latin

[00:32:42] America aspect, whereas Brazil is a self-contained country where most of the people in the world

[00:32:49] who speak Portuguese live, and Portugal barely counts.

[00:32:54] I do think it qualifies on the inward-looking piece.

[00:33:00] If you look at the history over the last 150 years, I think there have been four points

[00:33:06] where people were hyper-bullish on Brazil. I’m not going to get them exactly right, but there was one in the pre–World War I.

[00:33:12] There was one in the ’60s, in the ’50s, in the ’70s . . .

[00:33:17] TYLER COWEN: That’s right. PETER THIEL: . . . there was one, again, in recent years, and they all turned out to be

[00:33:21] false dawns. They were all linked to Brazil being tied into globalization.

[00:33:27] The optimism about Brazil, was always from all the potential that will happen, when it

[00:33:31] became linked to globalization, and then the disappointment happens when it turns out it

[00:33:35] doesn’t work. There was this giant energy company called OGX. The guy who started it was worth $30 billion in 2011.

[00:33:44] He’s now worth −$1 billion. You met with him in Rio de Janeiro.

[00:33:49] He had a McLaren parked in his living room in the villa, on a pedestal.

[00:33:55] He had just divorced his wife. He told me, “I can now park my car wherever I want.”

[00:33:59] [laughter] PETER THIEL: They had all these offshore oil

[00:34:04] concessions they’d gotten from the government, in relatively shallow water.

[00:34:08] It seemed like a fantastic investment. Then, it turned out you could only get Brazilian oil service companies to develop it.

[00:34:16] There were no Brazilian oil service companies. Maybe the oil didn’t exist at all. Maybe the whole thing was a giant fraud.

[00:34:20] Very hard to tell. These things work when people are bullish about integration, and globalization, and

[00:34:28] then the reality sets back in.

[00:34:32] It could be the case that it’s fairly decoupled, and the excess optimism came from people thinking

[00:34:37] it wasn’t. TYLER COWEN: You mentioned Facebook a few minutes ago. In the back, we were talking about good and bad names for companies.

[00:34:44] If you could tell us your view on this, how important is the name of a company?

[00:34:48] What are a few good names, and why, and what are a few bad names? PETER THIEL: A slight aesthetic thing I believe in very strongly is the names of companies

[00:35:01] are often very predictive of future failure or success.

[00:35:06] PayPal was a very friendly name. It was the friend that helps you pay.

[00:35:11] Napster was a bad name. It was the music sharing site. You nap some music, you nap a kid.

[00:35:16] That sounds like a bad thing to be doing. [laughter] PETER THIEL: It’s no wonder the government then comes in and shuts the company down, within a few years.

[00:35:23] You want to be very careful how you name companies.

[00:35:27] In the sharing economy context, I like Airbnb, way more than Uber.

[00:35:31] Airbnb sounds like this very innocent, virtual bed and breakfast.

[00:35:34] It’s [a] very light, nonthreatening company. Uber, it sounds like a bad name from Germany sometime in the 1930s.

[00:35:43] [laughter] PETER THIEL: What are you exactly above? Maybe the law?

[00:35:47] [laughter] PETER THIEL: This is probably something that, again, from government regulatory perspective, Airbnb is a vastly better name than Uber.

[00:35:57] On the social networking side, I would say that I actually think Facebook was a very

[00:36:03] good name. MySpace was a more problematic name.

[00:36:07] You can say that all these social networks involve both reading and writing.

[00:36:14] Unlike real life, you have to write, before you read. You first have to write some things about yourself, then you read more about other people.

[00:36:23] Over time, reading dominates writing. Facebook was about learning about people around you.

[00:36:29] About the real identities at Harvard. MySpace started among wannabe actors in Los Angeles, and it was about them coming up with

[00:36:35] fictional narratives around themselves, and then a lot of other people in LA, who are

[00:36:40] generally like that.

[00:36:44] Because reading dominates writing, Facebook would ultimately dominate MySpace.

[00:36:49] There’s a certain version where the whole product arc was implicit in the names.

[00:36:56] TYLER COWEN: How about United States? Overrated or underrated?

[00:37:01] And consider the name. [laughter] PETER THIEL: It’s hard for us to have good

[00:37:08] intuitions about this, because we are so used to it, and so embedded in the history.

[00:37:17] Certainly, this is all atavistic and way too old-fashioned, but I’d be sympathetic to

[00:37:23] the 19th century spelling, where the U was lowercase. TYLER COWEN: In chess.

[00:37:30] First move. E4 or D4. Which is better?

[00:37:35] PETER THIEL: It’s probably the case that D4 is marginally better at this point, because

[00:37:44] it looks like there are certain defenses to E4 that are very hard to break, like the Berlin

[00:37:49] defense. But I still always play E4. It’s what I’ve gotten used to.

[00:37:54] TYLER COWEN: Because it’s the attacking move, right? PETER THIEL: It’s the attacking move, and if you’re short of world champion level,

[00:38:02] I always enjoy increasing the risk involved and volatility in the game. TYLER COWEN: You were born in Germany.

[00:38:06] You are fluent in German. That’s part of your background. How do you think that’s influenced your worldview, what I would call your implicit

[00:38:13] theology, how the different pieces of Peter Thiel’s ideas fit together?

[00:38:17] What’s the role there, and do you still sometimes dream in German?

[00:38:22] PETER THIEL: We spoke German at home.

[00:38:25] We moved to the States when I was a year old, and we spoke German at home for the first

[00:38:30] 12 years. My parents didn’t have a TV set. We got a TV set at age 12, and then the English language overtook everything.

[00:38:38] It’s hard to generalize.

[00:38:43] California and Germany are extremely opposite kinds of places, in certain ways.

[00:38:47] I think of California as both very optimistic and somewhat desperate.

[00:38:53] You have 20,000 people a year move to Los Angeles to become movie stars, maybe 20 of

[00:38:58] them make it. All of California has a super-optimistic, but somewhat desperate . . .

[00:39:02] TYLER COWEN: It’s like Beach Boys music. Sounds optimistic on the surface but it’s deeply sad and melancholy.

[00:39:08] PETER THIEL: It may be something like that. [laughter] PETER THIEL: I think of Germany as always

[00:39:14] incredibly pessimistic, but very comfortable.

[00:39:19] It is this very big contrast.

[00:39:24] I’m not sure pessimism is generally that helpful an attitude to have, but the German

[00:39:32] pessimism is probably a helpful corrective, in the midst of the hyper-optimism that permeates

[00:39:37] Silicon Valley. If you are a mildly pessimistic person, you might do well in a place where people are

[00:39:43] insanely optimistic. If you are a mildly optimistic person, you would do well in a place where people are

[00:39:49] insanely pessimistic, like say Germany. TYLER COWEN: So maybe you are this mix of German pessimism and California optimism.

[00:39:55] Just like you said for Thiel fellowships, you look for people who embody these Zen contradictions.

[00:40:01] Maybe that’s one of yours: that the extreme pessimism has to do with the weirdness of

[00:40:05] the world, and the difficulty of breaking through the conformity, but at some level,

[00:40:09] you think it can be done—right—and you’ve done it. PETER THIEL: I always think extreme pessimism, or extreme optimism on their own terms, are

[00:40:16] not terribly healthy attitudes to have, because extreme pessimism tells you there’s no point

[00:40:24] in doing anything. Extreme optimism tells you there is no need to do anything.

[00:40:28] They converge on doing nothing. A healthy attitude is always either something that’s milder.

[00:40:34] Mild optimism, mild pessimism. I average out to a mild version, even though maybe the components are extreme.

[00:40:42] On average, it comes out somewhere in the middle. TYLER COWEN: I was emailed this question.

[00:40:47] What is your maximum likelihood estimate of when you will die? At what age?

[00:40:52] PETER THIEL: It depends a lot on what we do about this stuff.

[00:41:01] Again, it’s not as though the future exists on its own . . . TYLER COWEN: But you are forecasting you.

[00:41:06] PETER THIEL: It depends on what I do, and what I get other people to do in the next

[00:41:11] few decades. These things can go in very different directions.

[00:41:17] Whenever I look at the signs on these areas, I think there are many innovations that could

[00:41:22] happen, and then I think it’s incredibly slow.

[00:41:26] If I had to make a straightforward forecast, I would do a straight-line extrapolation,

[00:41:31] where life expectancy has gone up something like, 2.2 to 2.5 years per decade, since 1840.

[00:41:39] That would probably get me into my early to mid-90s. Then, you add maybe 10 years, so somewhere 100 to 110.

[00:41:49] That would be a pretty good upper case.

[00:41:54] There’s a lot of variability. If things end up stagnant, it’ll be not much more than what people would expect today.

[00:42:01] If things accelerate, it could be a lot longer. TYLER COWEN: A lot of those gains in life expectancy have come from people younger than

[00:42:07] 80. People who reached 80 in, say, 1870, did only marginally worse than people who reach 80

[00:42:13] today. That’s since I tend to be more pessimistic about many people reaching 100, though I would

[00:42:18] give you, in relative terms, perhaps the best chance of anyone in this room.

[00:42:22] PETER THIEL: That was true in the first half of the 20th century.

[00:42:29] In recent decades, more of the gains have come from somewhat older people, not necessarily

[00:42:33] from people who are 80 and up, but say people who are 60, 65, 70, of being able to live

[00:42:39] significantly longer than they were in the past. But you are right.

[00:42:42] We are not going to get than many gains from reductions in infant mortality, or things

[00:42:46] of that sort. It will come from people who are somewhat older, hopefully living both longer, and hopefully

[00:42:54] healthier, lives. TYLER COWEN: What’s your favorite novel? PETER THIEL: The classic one I always give is Lord of the Rings.

[00:43:01] If you want something a little more intellectual, it’s probably the Bulgakov novel The Master

[00:43:06] and Margarita where the devil shows up in Stalinist Russia, and succeeds, and gives

[00:43:11] everybody what they want, and everything goes haywire. It’s hard, because no one believes he’s real.

[00:43:16] TYLER COWEN: New Testament, or Old Testament? Which has influenced you more, and why?

[00:43:20] PETER THIEL: I’d have to go with something like the New Testament.

[00:43:27] These things are always subject to so much interpretation. I don’t think something like any of these holy books stand on their own.

[00:43:38] If they did, that’s always an antireligious argument at the end of the day.

[00:43:43] TYLER COWEN: The Hebrew Bible, to me, has more of this dialectic that we found in a

[00:43:47] lot of the other topics. Mix of optimism and pessimism. Much more irony, multiple voices, varying perspectives.

[00:43:55] My answer would be Hebrew Bible has influenced me much more than the New Testament, which

[00:43:59] has hardly influenced me at all. You are different in that way, but what is it in your character, intellect, or background,

[00:44:05] do you think accounts for that difference, given some of the other things you’ve said?

[00:44:15] PETER THIEL: I would disagree with that characterization of it.

[00:44:23] I think Christ is a very complex, very ambiguous figure in many ways, which makes the interpretation

[00:44:37] quite difficult. I think almost everything that Christ said could be described as an answer to something

[00:44:44] that’s true, that most people did not agree on. And I think for the most part, it was necessary for Christ to be very careful how he expressed

[00:44:51] himself. It was mostly in these extremely parabolic, indirect modalities, because if it had been

[00:44:59] too direct, it would have been very dangerous. It was John Locke, in The Reasonableness of Christianity, said that Christ obviously had

[00:45:07] to mislead people, since if he had not done so, the authorities might have tried to kill

[00:45:11] him. TYLER COWEN: There’s a kind of Straussian Christ here? PETER THIEL: That’s the Straussian interpretation of Christ.

[00:45:19] It didn’t end in a particularly Straussian way, but it was at least true for most of

[00:45:23] his ministry. TYLER COWEN: What do you hope to spend the next year thinking about, ideas or questions

[00:45:29] you haven’t thought through already, that will be your focus in the next year or two

[00:45:33] to come? Things that we haven’t talked about already. PETER THIEL: I don’t know if it’s ever really this top-down agenda that I try to

[00:45:42] set. A lot of what I end up doing is somewhat serendipitous.

[00:45:47] You talk with a lot of interesting people. You try to figure out what are some great technologies, great entrepreneurs to work

[00:45:53] with in different ways. That’s how you end up getting very interesting perspectives, and how you change your mind

[00:45:59] on things. The overarching agenda is always to try to figure out some way to get out of the stagnation

[00:46:07] by literally helping people to start companies that will change the world.

[00:46:11] TYLER COWEN: Before we get to audience Q&A, final question from me.

[00:46:15] You’ve done many start-ups, funded many others, you’ve written Zero to One on start-ups.

[00:46:21] If you think of the Institute for Humane Studies and Mercatus Center as a kind of start-up:

[00:46:26] we are together in one location. We have a critical mass of people here, studying notions of liberty and individual responsibility.

[00:46:35] We have, more or less, a common intellectual background in some ways.

[00:46:40] I wouldn’t say we have a monopoly, but the space of doing liberty-oriented ideas in a

[00:46:46] university setting is by no means what everyone is jumping at doing, to say the least.

[00:46:52] If you think of us as a start-up, embodying at least some characteristics which have something

[00:46:57] to do with what you’ve praised, what advice would you give us at the margin, for being

[00:47:02] successful in the future? PETER THIEL: All those elements are quite good.

[00:47:12] I think that it’s always a mistake to be too focused on prestige and status.

[00:47:24] This is always the great temptation in many areas. Academia is one that’s extremely prone to this.

[00:47:32] I would always be long substance, short status.

[00:47:38] The temptation is to try to get more respectability within an academic setting, or within some

[00:47:44] sort of a broader audience. If you try to get respectability, it will always come at a price of softening the edges,

[00:47:55] modulating what you say. You want to always put substance over status.

[00:48:00] If that was a single overarching theme, that would be a very, very healthy one

[00:48:27] to maintain.

[00:48:32] AUDIENCE Q&A AUDIENCE MEMBER: You talk about vertical progress

[00:48:53] versus horizontal progress. I’m wondering, how does one create vertical progress?

[00:48:59] Do you have any tips for doing that?

[00:49:03] PETER THIEL: There’s no straightforward formula for innovation.

[00:49:14] It’s much easier to do horizontal progress, which I describe as globalization, copying

[00:49:19] things that work going from one to n, versus vertical progress, technology, doing new things,

[00:49:23] going from zero to one. Globalization, I think there is actually a formula.

[00:49:27] You can copy what’s working, try to mechanically apply it.

[00:49:32] There’s something scientific about globalization.

[00:49:36] There’s something deeply unscientific about the history of technology itself.

[00:49:40] Science starts with the number two, whereas every moment in the history of science, technology,

[00:49:45] business, I believe, happens only once. The next Mark Zuckerberg won’t start a social network, the next Larry Page won’t start

[00:49:52] a search engine. It’s always some idiosyncratic thing.

[00:49:58] It’s good to be passionate about something that you are good at, that other people are

[00:50:05] not doing. If you get those three things lined up, that’s a very good start.

[00:50:13] AUDIENCE MEMBER: In order to go from zero to one in a nonprofit organization, or a political

[00:50:32] advocacy group, what would one have to do? What would be a key differentiator, or angle, to approach with it?

[00:50:40] PETER THIEL: The contrarian business question is what are great businesses no one has started,

[00:50:49] the contrarian investor question is what great investments does nobody like—the contrarian

[00:50:56] nonprofit question is what great causes are deeply unpopular?

[00:51:03] This is how I always deflect requests for money, is I ask people, “Why is your cause

[00:51:08] popular? Why is your cause unpopular?” Because I only want to fund unpopular causes. I assume popular causes are funded relatively well.

[00:51:14] Relative to good, unpopular causes.

[00:51:20] If you are able to push unpopular causes, that’s very good.

[00:51:26] Then, the Zen-like problem, the paradox, is that you have a lot of impact, if you are

[00:51:32] able to push a good, worthwhile, but unpopular cause.

[00:51:37] The Zen paradox, is that it’s very hard to market it and get money to do it.

[00:51:41] That’s the tension that it’s worth thinking through really hard.

[00:51:45] I think most nonprofits fail at this, where they end up supporting things that are super

[00:51:51] conventional, they can get funding for them, but if they didn’t do it, there’d be 100

[00:51:56] other people doing it. Always having a counterfactual sense of mission is important.

[00:52:02] If we weren’t doing this, nobody else in the world would be doing this. To the extent that’s not true, you want to make that more true.

[00:52:09] Maybe it’s a spectrum, but you want to always tilt more in that direction.

[00:52:14] On the business side, on the nonprofit side, I always differentiate mission-oriented businesses,

[00:52:20] which have this counterfactual sense of importance, from social entrepreneurship.

[00:52:26] Anything that has a social element to it—the word social is very ambiguous.

[00:52:30] It can mean, number one, good for society. It can mean, number two, good as seen by society.

[00:52:36] In practice, the second meaning always ends up dominating the first.

[00:52:40] Then, you end up with the “me too,” lemming-like, sheep-like clones, where you lose every raison

[00:52:48] d’être. AUDIENCE MEMBER: In an age increasingly dominated by intellectual ability, what should a person

[00:53:04] of modest cognitive ability do with his life, to find meaning or make a contribution?

[00:53:10] Related to that, what person of average, or modest, intelligence do you admire most?

[00:53:14] [laughter] PETER THIEL: I’m not going to answer the

[00:53:21] second question, because I’m always nervous that I’d be insulting people if I did.

[00:53:33] There are a lot of things that people can do, that are strikingly underexplored.

[00:53:43] There are certainly all these vocational careers where people can do quite well.

[00:53:51] They are somehow considered not cool, not prestigious.

[00:53:55] The average plumber makes about as much as the average medical doctor.

[00:54:03] I do think this idea of what’s unfashionable is very important as an initial anchor.

[00:54:11] There’s no reason that people of average ability are going to be more pushed towards

[00:54:17] what’s fashionable than people who are very smart. I think often the smarter people are more prone to trendy, fashionable thinking because

[00:54:26] they can pick up on things, they can pick up on cues more easily, and so they’re even more trapped by it than people of average ability.

[00:54:34] AUDIENCE MEMBER: I’m going to take you on in your challenge about sharing something

[00:54:44] we know to be true that everyone disagrees with, and then ask you a question about it.

[00:54:49] The truth that I know to be the case is that the future of human evolution and how we think

[00:54:54] about how we structure society lies in privately funded, managed, for-profit cities built in

[00:55:02] partnership with, but independent from, governments today in the world.

[00:55:08] My question to you, and then also I have a follow-up for Dr. Cowen, is “What do we

[00:55:13] need to do to enlist your powerful support in that view, in addition to getting introduced

[00:55:20] by someone in your inner circle?” Dr. Cowen, my question to you is, “What do we need to do to be on that stage, having

[00:55:27] a similar conversation with you and the crowd that you have managed to get out here?”

[00:55:32] PETER THIEL: I think there are many things that would be incredibly terrific to do.

[00:55:42] The business version would be “Is this important?”

[00:55:50] If we could reopen the frontier in geopolitical terms and find a way to really innovate on

[00:55:56] society, I think this would be a terrific thing to do. Then the question “How does one actually do this?” is very tricky.

[00:56:06] All the surface area on this planet is occupied. It seems very hard to get this to work.

[00:56:12] I know Romer had this experiment with these city-states in Africa.

[00:56:15] I think it was prohibitively expensive. It could never really quite get started.

[00:56:21] You need to have some version of where this would work and you could get started with

[00:56:27] a budget of let’s say less than $50 billion.

[00:56:31] If you could give me a convincing way it would work for $50 million instead of $50 billion,

[00:56:37] I’d be interested. TYLER COWEN: Your question addressed to me. I have a graduate student and also a colleague who are working on the economics of private

[00:56:45] cities. Not private cities being completely separate from larger political units, but largely private

[00:56:52] cities with mostly private infrastructure nonetheless. If you’re talking about private cities truly independent of government, I would call those

[00:57:00] “cruise ships.” [laughter] TYLER COWEN: We do have many of them.

[00:57:05] I think they work fine, but I don’t view them as a significant blow for liberty.

[00:57:11] In fact, when I go on a cruise ship, I actually worry about some of the liberties I’m signing

[00:57:16] away. I know I do that voluntarily. It’s fine. I don’t object to that.

[00:57:21] I tend to favor larger political units and to think that human freedom will be found

[00:57:27] by the wealth and diversity within larger political units giving people pockets.

[00:57:32] I’m not sure we’ll ever have a bottom-down creation of a lot of micro-units which compete

[00:57:37] very intensely and through exit give people true liberty. I’m more optimistic about the larger political unit vision, but maybe that’s a matter of

[00:57:46] taste. In terms of these events, you or anyone else feel free to write me.

[00:57:56] AUDIENCE MEMBER: In a 2009 Cato Unbound article, you discussed your disillusionment with democracy

[00:58:07] as a source of innovation and change in government and politics and expressed your interest in

[00:58:11] cyberspace, outer space, and seasteading. Is there a 2015 update on how you’re feeling about government and politics and innovation?

[00:58:19] PETER THIEL: Writing is always such a dangerous thing. [laughter] PETER THIEL: I remember a professor once told

[00:58:27] me back in the ’80s that writing a book was more dangerous than having a child because

[00:58:31] you could always disown a child if it turned out badly. [laughter] PETER THIEL: You could never disown anything

[00:58:35] that you’ve written. The Cato Unbound article, it was a thousand-word essay.

[00:58:42] It was late at night. I quickly typed it off. I sent it to someone else to review, who said, “There’s nothing controversial in here

[00:58:48] at all.” My retrospective was that if you actually ask someone to double-check things for whether

[00:58:53] or not it’s controversial, you already deep-down know that you should double-check it yourself.

[00:59:01] My updated version on it would be that—I made the case that I thought democracy and

[00:59:07] capitalism weren’t quite compatible—the updated version I would give is it’s not

[00:59:12] at all clear that we’re living in anything resembling a democracy.

[00:59:15] We’re living in a representative republic, but then that’s modified through a judicial

[00:59:23] system. Of course, that’s been largely superseded by these very unelected agencies of one sort

[00:59:29] or another, which really drive most of the decision-making.

[00:59:34] I think calling our society a democracy, whatever may be good or bad about democracy, is very,

[00:59:42] very deeply misleading. We’re not a republic. We’re not a constitutional republic.

[00:59:46] We are actually a state that’s dominated by these very unelected, technocratic agencies.

[00:59:56] The very difficult political question is, “How can you get an advanced, technological

[01:00:00] society to function in any way that’s more republican or more democratic at all?”

[01:00:07] Not at all sure how that is, but I think the challenge is that a lot of these agencies

[01:00:11] have become deeply sclerotic, deeply nonfunctioning, even though the alternatives to them, politically,

[01:00:17] often seem to be even worse. The Federal Reserve—lots of things they do, I don’t like, but then once you get

[01:00:24] people in Congress involved in dictating Fed policy, that always seems even worse.

[01:00:28] TYLER COWEN: A follow-up on that, Peter. New Zealand arguably is the most democratic country in the world, I would say, or very

[01:00:35] close to the most democratic. Given that, New Zealand, overrated or underrated?

[01:00:41] PETER THIEL: Again, I think it’s more like a representative democracy or republic.

[01:00:48] TYLER COWEN: There’s no constitution. There’s close to only one branch of government, very little federalism.

[01:00:54] PETER THIEL: I think a lot of these smaller countries are somewhat underrated generally

[01:01:02] because you have an adaptability, an ability to change things that can move a lot faster.

[01:01:09] Again, I don’t think it’s the form of government that matters so much. I think it’s often the culture . . . TYLER COWEN: The size.

[01:01:14] PETER THIEL: . . . how well things work, to some extent the size. I think those are elements that are very positive.

[01:01:21] In a world where globalization is going in reverse, one rough approximation is you want

[01:01:31] to go on a place on the planet that’s as far away from the Middle East as you can get.

[01:01:37] If you do that on a physical globe, it’s somewhere in the southern hemisphere.

[01:01:40] It’s basically halfway between New Zealand and Tahiti.

[01:01:44] If you had to pick them, I’d go with New Zealand over French Polynesia, which is where

[01:01:49] the people in France go, who find the work hours in France too onerous.

[01:01:53] [laughter] TYLER COWEN: Tonga. AUDIENCE MEMBER: How would you evaluate the government of the United States as an investor

[01:02:02] in innovation and technology? Perhaps you would consider referring to rockets to the moon, the transcontinental railroad,

[01:02:12] drug development, and solar energy. Or any other innovations you care to stress.

[01:02:18] PETER THIEL: These are all obviously quite different.

[01:02:24] There’s a libertarian perspective which I have, which is that it’s extremely bad,

[01:02:34] but that’s present tense. I think the nonlibertarian perspective that I think we always should think about a little

[01:02:40] bit harder is that there’s also also been a tremendous decline.

[01:02:45] I think in the 1930s and 1940s you had a degree of technocratic competence that was quite

[01:02:53] significant. Today, a letter from Einstein would get lost in the White House mail room.

[01:02:58] The Manhattan Project would be unthinkable.

[01:03:01] Apollo would be unthinkable. I think the first signal one that really went wrong was Nixon’s war on cancer.

[01:03:09] I always do think the 1970s were this decade where many of our institutions, especially

[01:03:14] our governmental institutions, started to work much less well.

[01:03:19] That was perhaps the signal one where things went badly wrong.

[01:03:26] In terms of investing in science and technology, it seems to me that the minimum criterion

[01:03:33] for doing it is to have some understanding of these things and some ability to evaluate

[01:03:38] them properly. In a government in which two-thirds of the representatives are lawyers and in which . . . Again,

[01:03:48] just using the House and Senate as a proxy for our government, by generous count, no

[01:03:54] more than 35 have degrees in engineering or science or anything like that, or any technical

[01:03:59] field, very generously defined, both the House and Senate.

[01:04:03] Perhaps these are not the right people to be driving these investments.

[01:04:07] I think we, again, should have much more of a focus on substance, much less on process.

[01:04:11] I always use the Solyndra bankruptcy as an example in this question of what went wrong.

[01:04:17] There’s a Republican process critique. The process was screwed up.

[01:04:21] There were kickbacks. Somehow, there was this corruption. They could never quite prove it, but that was the intuition.

[01:04:26] The Democratic defense was, “We had a process. We had a portfolio, a financial process where we gave money to lots of different things.”

[01:04:33] You let 100 flowers bloom or something like that.

[01:04:39] A mathematical objection to it was that a cylinder has 2πr the surface area of a flat

[01:04:48] panel, which would be 2r and therefore is, by definition, 1 over π as efficient as a

[01:04:55] flat panel. You could just use ninth-grade, high school geometry to show that this was a demonstrably

[01:05:00] inferior technology. It was never going to be commercially viable.

[01:05:04] You have a Nobel laureate, Steve Chu, running the Energy Department who is not allowed to

[01:05:10] use ninth-grade high school geometry in evaluating what to do.

[01:05:15] That sort of a society, that sort of a government is one that should not be allowed to make

[01:05:20] any investments in these areas whatsoever.

[01:05:25] AUDIENCE MEMBER: In the libertarian utopia that you will build, what will you use for

[01:05:32] money? Will it look more like Bitcoin or more like PayPal? PETER THIEL: I’m not exactly sure that I’m going to succeed in building a libertarian

[01:05:43] utopia.

[01:05:47] I actually do think that there’s a little bit too much of a fixation on this monetarist

[01:05:55] level, and not enough on the underlying real economy.

[01:06:06] I think that, for example, we have a lot of these debates about Fed policy.

[01:06:11] Are they printing too much money? Are they not printing enough? What should the Fed be doing?

[01:06:16] Somehow, do you decentralize that?

[01:06:20] I think money and the nature of money is somehow much less important than all the microregulations

[01:06:26] that make up the economy. If you give me a choice of getting rid of the vast bulk of government regulations and

[01:06:34] keeping the Fed, I’d much rather do that than keeping all the other zoning laws and

[01:06:39] crazy rules we have and going with PayPal, Bitcoin, gold, any sort of alternate currency

[01:06:48] one could come up with. I’d much prefer to focus on the level of atoms, the real economy, than on the virtual

[01:06:56] level of bits, which I think of money as being linked to.

[01:07:00] My intuition, for what it’s worth, is that you’d want money to somehow be linked back

[01:07:07] to the real, in a fundamental way. This was the merit of the gold standard, that it would at least maintain this discipline

[01:07:14] that money was not something that grew on trees and could be printed ad infinitum, and

[01:07:21] so I’d want it to be linked to something real. Maybe you link it to the equity market, or something that’s somewhat more real than

[01:07:29] just fiat money. I think the much more critical thing are all the microregulations.

[01:07:34] AUDIENCE MEMBER: I work for the Indonesian government as an advisor.

[01:07:41] I have two questions for you. The first is, do you think Indonesia is underrated or overrated, and number two, what would you

[01:07:50] recommend for my government to fight off terrorism?

[01:07:55] Because you talk a lot about monopoly in your book. Is it possible for my government to monopolize information security, yet at the same time,

[01:08:05] respect the individual privacy of our citizens?

[01:08:09] PETER THIEL: Wow. Again, I’m not totally sure if I have a great answer on that off the top.

[01:08:18] I think that I don’t know if the right question for many of these countries is what to do

[01:08:25] on the level of the country itself. Indonesia has 200-plus different islands, it’s extremely heterogeneous as a place.

[01:08:34] I think that if things were somewhat more decentralized, that probably would be the

[01:08:41] direction that one would be tempted to go in.

[01:08:46] I don’t know all about the details of the terrorism issue in Indonesia; my sense is

[01:08:53] that a lot of these national security debates have involved these fake tradeoffs in many

[01:08:57] different places. It’s always you do more with more, or less with less.

[01:09:02] You have more security with more privacy invasions—a more centralized, powerful state.

[01:09:07] Versus, you have less security with more privacy.

[01:09:12] It’s almost like the NSA versus the ACLU, and I think this is a very fake dichotomy.

[01:09:18] The technological solution I would like is where you do more with less, where we have

[01:09:23] more security with fewer invasions of privacy and we try to find ways to actually do things

[01:09:29] that are much smarter. That’s what I would define as actual innovation in a space.

[01:09:34] We can always do more with more, versus less with less, and that’s the boring ideological

[01:09:39] debate we’re always stuck with.

[01:09:56] AUDIENCE MEMBER: Why do you have an appetite to live longer, and what’s your life’s

[01:10:13] mission? Have you fulfilled your life’s mission yet? PETER THIEL: I think it’s somewhat independent of a life mission.

[01:10:21] I actually think life is something that’s worthwhile in and of itself.

[01:10:26] Death is kind of a bad thing, in [and] of itself, so even if I was adrift and had no

[01:10:32] sense of what I was doing at all, I would still all else being equal, hopefully prefer

[01:10:37] to live a lot longer. I always think it’s very odd how weirdly strange the anti-aging, life extension idea

[01:10:50] is. I always think, “Why would people think that you would need a life mission or some

[01:10:55] extraordinary reason to want to live longer?”

[01:10:59] Part of it goes to these very strange psychological ways we deal with mortality, through a combination

[01:11:06] of acceptance and denial. We accept that we’re all going to die, and so we don’t do anything, and we think we’re

[01:11:17] not going to die anytime soon, so we don’t really need to worry about it.

[01:11:20] We have this sort of schizophrenic combination of acceptance and denial, like extreme pessimism

[01:11:26] and extreme optimism. It converges to doing nothing, and I’d like us to just fight it a little bit more for

[01:11:32] its own sake. TYLER COWEN: Over here.

[01:11:37] AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you accept for the moment the premise that in general, the sort of free-market

[01:11:45] system we have has done a pretty fair job on the production side, but that there may

[01:11:49] be a secular threat to its success on the distributional side—in other words, increased

[01:11:56] concentration of wealth, perhaps due to technology changes—is there a way to substitute something

[01:12:03] on the distribution side without harming the effective progress performance on the production

[01:12:12] side? PETER THIEL: I’m not sure I agree with all those premises.

[01:12:20] That would be point number one.

[01:12:23] I always think on this inequality debate, you have to always separate into three separate

[01:12:28] questions. One, is it even going up? It’s probably going up in the US, not going up globally, so the Gini coefficient of the

[01:12:35] world, not even clear that’s going up. Let’s grant number one. Then you have a second question, why is this happening, and then a third question, what

[01:12:42] to do about it? I think these things are very different.

[01:12:48] Why it is happening: I tend to blame it more on globalization than technology.

[01:12:53] I think it’s very overdetermined by many different things that are very hard to solve,

[01:13:00] and then I think what to do about it: many of the remedies are actually worse than the

[01:13:08] disease. If you come up with higher marginal tax rates, for example, you probably will just incent

[01:13:19] people to come up with more loopholes; maybe it hurts the middle class more than the wealthy.

[01:13:24] If you actually look at societies with officially very redistributionist policies, they seem

[01:13:30] to get more and more static the more redistributionist the rhetoric is.

[01:13:35] You have to go very far left before you actually get to effective redistribution.

[01:13:40] Venezuela is not left-wing enough to get the redistribution. You have to go probably all the way to Cuba, Soviet Union, things like that.

[01:13:49] France, not nearly far enough. I’d rather go in a very different direction.

[01:13:56] My sense is always that it’s basically that the issue is not inequality, the issue is

[01:14:01] much more stagnation. There’s a sense of people’s living standards are generally not improving that much, and

[01:14:09] then, what can you do about that? What are the microsolutions for that?

[01:14:15] In Silicon Valley, San Francisco, where I live, I would say the single biggest variable

[01:14:21] that makes people feel the stagnation is the sense in which housing costs, rental costs,

[01:14:27] are through the roof.

[01:14:31] The political fix I would be tempted to pursue would be trying to find a way to break the

[01:14:36] unholy alliance between urban slumlords and pseudo-environmentalists that sort of prevent

[01:14:42] any new urban development. But I think it’s always much more a problem of stagnation than inequality.

[01:14:48] TYLER COWEN: Let’s try to squeeze three more questions into the last five minutes.

[01:14:54] Next. AUDIENCE MEMBER: A few years ago, I came up with a proposal that debuted a human physiological

[01:15:09] simulator after the Human Genome Project to further push the IT and the life science revolution

[01:15:17] forward. I managed to talk to Dr. Collins from the NIH, who was the director then, and his answer

[01:15:24] was, “Great idea, but it’s too hard to do.” I wanted to get your response to that.

[01:15:28] PETER THIEL: Yeah, I’d probably agree with that.

[01:15:33] That seems a little bit hard to do. I generally find myself a bit skeptical of all the AI-themed discussions that we have

[01:15:43] at this point. I think it’s still quite a bit further away than people think.

[01:15:48] It feels like a bit of an extreme consensus that AI is just around the corner, it’s

[01:15:54] about to happen. It would take a lot longer to explain all my misgivings about it, but I think it fits

[01:16:01] a little bit too much into this conventional inequality narrative, that we have rapid technological

[01:16:05] progress, and the only problem is that people won’t have jobs, they’ll be replaced by

[01:16:13] computers. I suspect that’s not quite correct. I think the whole AI story is, if anything, happening more slowly.

[01:16:21] The data point people always give is self-driving cars. The fact that they always come up with the same example suggests that maybe there’s

[01:16:27] not that much to it. Even if you got—and I think self-driven cars would be significant—it might replace

[01:16:32] at most 1 percent of the workforce, it might increase productivity by a few percent in

[01:16:37] the economy. If you phased them in over a decade, it would not be that transformative.

[01:16:41] AUDIENCE MEMBER: What do you see as the biggest changes in the practice of science, say, over

[01:16:49] the last 50 years, for better, for worse, from the perspective of innovation, and whether

[01:16:54] you think that the public consciousness or concept of science has matched those changes?

[01:17:02] PETER THIEL: It’s gone dramatically for the worse.

[01:17:10] The basic narrative I would give is that we had this preexisting ecosystem of idiosyncratic

[01:17:18] scientists who were driving research in all sorts of independent ways.

[01:17:25] You could dramatically accelerate it by giving them a lot of money, which is what we did

[01:17:29] in the 1930s to 1960s, but it came at this price of suddenly politicizing the system.

[01:17:36] The problem is that a good scientist is very much the opposite—now, this may be more

[01:17:43] like 180 degrees, not 175 degrees, it’s 179.5 degrees—the opposite of a good politician.

[01:17:50] It’s like, a scientist is someone who’s interested in the truth, a politician is someone who has a very troubled relationship with the truth.

[01:17:57] I think we’ve had this sort of Gresham’s law, where the bad scientists have driven

[01:18:01] out the good, or people who are nimble in the art of writing government grant applications

[01:18:06] have replaced the eccentric scientists who’ve really pushed the research.

[01:18:12] I think that’s sort of this deep corruption of the process.

[01:18:16] It’s very hard for the public to fully appreciate it, because science is so specialized.

[01:18:25] Who am I to evaluate superstring research, or quantum computing research, or nanotech,

[01:18:31] or immunotherapy as applied to cancer?

[01:18:35] Because of this extreme specialization of science, you have these self-reinforcing expert

[01:18:40] communities that have made this process of politicization extremely opaque to the broader

[01:18:48] public. I’m very much in favor of science, but I’m skeptical of people who excessively invoke

[01:18:59] science as an incantation of sorts.

[01:19:03] When you use the word science it’s often a tell, like in poker, that you’re bluffing

[01:19:09] and that no science at all is going on. We have political science, we have social science.

[01:19:14] We don’t have physical science or chemical science. There are just physics and chemistry, there’s no debate.

[01:19:21] If you think about other areas where people use the word science excessively, I think

[01:19:25] those are areas that we should perhaps be a lot more skeptical of.

[01:19:30] AUDIENCE MEMBER: How happy are the super-rich?

[01:19:36] [laughter] AUDIENCE MEMBER: First-hand experience, or

[01:19:44] all the super-rich people you know, or both? PETER THIEL: I’m not sure this is a terribly easy thing to measure.

[01:19:50] I think it’s extremely, deeply subjective, that people probably have fewer worries about

[01:19:57] money. They have a lot of worries about how excessive money screws up relationships in different

[01:20:05] ways. I think there probably are plusses and minuses. But I’ve always questioned the premise of the question.

[01:20:10] I’m not sure whether subjective happiness should be the most important metric at which

[01:20:16] we evaluate things. There’s many other metrics we can use. TYLER COWEN: Peter, thank you very much.

[01:20:20] PETER THIEL: Thank you very much, thanks.
