[Peter Thiel - Interview 1996 [C-span]](https://youtu.be/g_OPJYDLyyM)

[00:00:01] we're back with the newspaper Round Table this morning joining us is Ellen Moran

[00:00:05] of Emily's List she's the training director there and Peter

[00:00:08] till the independent Institute and he's a research fellow

[00:00:12] there he's also written a book his co-author was here

[00:00:16] some time ago David saxs and the book is called the diversity

[00:00:20] myth the two of them are going to be our newspaper Roundtable this morning

[00:00:24] and we invite you to join us let's start first with your first

[00:00:27] article Mr till well I think the most important article was the uh

[00:00:31] the uh tww bombing one crash Clues point to bomb

[00:00:35] uh it now looks like there was an actual bombing that took place

[00:00:39] on the tww jet that's certainly the preponderance of the evidence people are still

[00:00:43] bit hesitant to uh make that point explicitly what I think

[00:00:46] is very interesting about it uh is that there does seem to be some evidence now that it was

[00:00:50] the same people who um masterminded the bombing of the World Trade Center

[00:00:54] are behind the tww bombing at least that's the preliminary speculation

[00:00:58] and certainly if that's the case um this does lead to all sorts of

[00:01:01] questions as to what we're going to do going forward what uh what the

[00:01:05] problem is I mean you know it's very sad what happened but I think the real question we

[00:01:09] have to ask ourselves is how do we prevent something like this going forward

[00:01:12] and uh if this is part of the same pattern that you had in the World Trade Center

[00:01:16] bombing I think the threat of Islamic terrorism in the US may

[00:01:20] be really a long-term thing the World Trade Center may not have been an isolated

[00:01:24] instance and this is going to be a real problem just quickly you mentioned there was some evidence

[00:01:27] that seemed to indicate it what was that evidence well the uh in

[00:01:31] the Baltimore Sun there was um there was some uh was an article

[00:01:34] where um ABC News um has apparently

[00:01:38] received a claim of responsibility for the tww explosion from a group

[00:01:41] tried to Ramsey YF he is the uh he was the

[00:01:45] guy who was The Mastermind of the World Trade Center I guess he's suspected

[00:01:49] of being The Mastermind there and so that's that's the one group that so far

[00:01:52] claimed credit you never know whether that's right or not but uh

[00:01:56] but certainly if it is uh it suggests there's a real problem here

[00:02:00] Miss Moran well another article that I was

[00:02:04] looking at that sort of begs your question of where are we going to go from

[00:02:07] here was in the post let's see if I can find

[00:02:11] it regarding the scanning devices um

[00:02:15] that could potentially be used at

[00:02:18] airports to scan checked luggage I of course just found

[00:02:22] out this week that my luggage when I check it is not scanned so I didn't

[00:02:26] realize that and uh uh it would appear that in the

[00:02:29] last 10 years they've made some um efforts to

[00:02:33] uh tighten the security at airports and there's a a little box here

[00:02:37] that talks about during the Gulf War how they tighten security but the

[00:02:40] fact remains that anyone can check luggage um

[00:02:44] getting onto a plane and there's no way of knowing what's inside it

[00:02:47] because it's not x-rayed um the unfortunate

[00:02:51] side of this or that the debate that's going to ensue of course is

[00:02:55] that uh these machines cost about a million dollars each so

[00:02:59] um that article you're talking about written by Lori goodstein

[00:03:03] with the Washington Post mentions in the lead that the latest scanners which

[00:03:06] can detect the most elusive plastic explosives capable of blowing up a 747

[00:03:10] are not routinely used and she indicates

[00:03:14] that primarily cost are prohibitive what's what do you make of

[00:03:17] that well they are prohibitive and I you know the airlines are under

[00:03:21] tremendous pressure to um you know keep their

[00:03:25] businesses solvent and you know the airports are

[00:03:28] you know and the government that regulates this certainly are uh under

[00:03:32] tremendous pressure to keep the costs down but

[00:03:36] obviously it is looming larger as a safety issue

[00:03:39] for the public and so um I think that that's what the next debate

[00:03:43] is going to be around is whether or not um

[00:03:47] we can introduce these machines in more airports apparently they're being tested

[00:03:51] in uh San Francisco and Atlanta right now tell me

[00:03:54] a little tell us a little bit about what you do for U EMILY's List I know you're the training

[00:03:58] director but what what what does that job in tale um

[00:04:02] when I started at em list about three years ago uh we initiated

[00:04:06] a campaign training program uh primarily or initially

[00:04:10] for staff uh campaign staff people who go out and

[00:04:13] work on campaigns um as campaign professionals

[00:04:17] uh we train campaign managers press secretaries and fundraisers

[00:04:21] over the course of 3 to six days um we give them

[00:04:25] um an intensive training and we invite experts in the various fields to come

[00:04:28] and speak to the the campaign staff um additionally I help

[00:04:32] uh recruit and assess candidates um for support

[00:04:36] by Emily's List as you know we support pro-choice Democratic women running

[00:04:39] for House and Senate and gubernatorial races Mr

[00:04:43] T um another story yes sir well let's see

[00:04:47] another story that I I thought was quite interesting this is um this is more sort of a

[00:04:51] background story was in the uh Baltimore Sun um

[00:04:55] assault case fuels tension at Academy

[00:04:59] and this is a story on the Naval Academy where apparently

[00:05:02] there's another one of these sexual harassment uh charged cases

[00:05:06] is is emerging and uh what's very interesting about this story

[00:05:10] is that unlike the tail Hook scandal where basically the Navy just

[00:05:14] uh took it and was beaten up for years and years in the

[00:05:17] Press at this point uh people are fighting back and uh

[00:05:21] and you know the initial story was that this mid Shipman Scott Ward had sexually

[00:05:25] assaulted a number of women this was the initial charge and but then

[00:05:28] he did not just take this lying down he got some lawyers involved

[00:05:32] and as the more they looked into the story the more it started to unravel it turned

[00:05:36] out that he had a relationship with one of the women and so that's of course already makes it much

[00:05:39] much trickier to suggest that there was any real sexual assault and there were a

[00:05:43] lot of mixed motivations and what I what I think this is symptomatic of is

[00:05:47] that we are um we've reached a point where people are a little bit more skeptical in our

[00:05:50] society about sort of the politically correct uh Crusades and

[00:05:54] when there's a sexual harassment case we are much more skeptical whether

[00:05:58] there was real harassment we're willing to to ask some questions uh that

[00:06:01] were not necessarily being asked four or five years ago and I think that's that's a very positive

[00:06:05] development because sexual harassment is a very serious charge

[00:06:09] and uh serious charges need to be corroborated M Mor

[00:06:12] um yes I uh took a look at that article

[00:06:16] um clearly um this gentleman

[00:06:20] is uh you know entitled to a fair

[00:06:23] uh hearing on this issue but um in reading the uh

[00:06:27] initial um article on this that it appears as

[00:06:31] though uh the women are claiming that you know he after a

[00:06:34] night of partying went into dorm rooms and demanded to have sex with the people

[00:06:38] with the women in the in the rooms now if that is not

[00:06:42] the case and he is unduly charged then you know obviously

[00:06:46] that's uh you know you know that's that's

[00:06:49] too bad but I think that these things need to be taken very seriously

[00:06:53] and regardless of whether or not he had a relationship pre-existing um

[00:06:57] with some one of the women who are ing this claim

[00:07:01] um who's on trial here I mean you know obviously

[00:07:05] um that relationship doesn't mean that he's not guilty either

[00:07:09] that that's true however you know if if you have a charge and serious

[00:07:13] charge like this um and someone brings it and it's false that's a very very bad

[00:07:17] thing one of the interesting things was of course that some of the women talked about

[00:07:20] how a sexual harassment charge would totally destroy this guy who had you know

[00:07:24] a great had great credentials a great career going for him and that's why we

[00:07:28] need to take this stuff very serious iously and that's why political correctness

[00:07:32] and sort of the hunt for sexism racism sexual harassment

[00:07:35] these sorts of things is not there are opportunity costs to this if you if you

[00:07:39] have a charge that's wrong people do get hurt and often very badly and

[00:07:43] uh I'm I'm I'm glad to see that that we're being a little bit more skeptical of that

[00:07:47] this article in the Baltimore son that was brought up has a portion

[00:07:50] of it it's written by three writers Tom Bowman Scott Shane and Joanna damri

[00:07:54] um it reads for the scandals guard Naval Academy the Scott Ward

[00:07:58] case is exposed larger conflict when Ward's friends whisper about a feminist

[00:08:02] conspiracy to frame him and the women's friends say the

[00:08:05] Academy's Macho culture punishes women who dare complain they

[00:08:09] speak across a Chasm that divides the institution similar to the

[00:08:13] division between you two what do you make of that in a larger scheme I

[00:08:16] think in the larger scheme I'm not I think military

[00:08:20] acmy are flas points for these kinds of disputes because

[00:08:24] uh you know women are just beginning to um gain

[00:08:27] Acceptance in larger numbers they're obviously still in a very

[00:08:31] small minority at most of theseis um

[00:08:35] you know it becomes the flasho I think for the public debate

[00:08:39] on um you know these issues of sexual harassment in the

[00:08:43] workplace and uh you know the debate over

[00:08:46] you know as you refer to political correctness

[00:08:50] well I think I think that's I think that's true it is obviously symptomatic of of

[00:08:54] much more that's going on but you know it's also the case I think that these

[00:08:57] militarys are viewed as institutions that

[00:09:01] uh you know that it sort of ties into the whole debate over the Clinton Administration

[00:09:05] and um sort of the tension between the Clinton Administration and the military has

[00:09:09] I think played another role in this in this whole debate where basically

[00:09:13] they you know they were there's there there's a sense in which a lot of people in the

[00:09:17] Clinton Administration are not sympathetic to the military a lot of people in the military

[00:09:21] have felt under tremendous attack at these these institutions have sort of

[00:09:25] felt that they've been attacked relentlessly certainly the tail Hook scandal in the Navy

[00:09:29] where you know the initial aviators were presumably quite guilty but then you

[00:09:33] had more and more careers were implicated lives ruined as it widened

[00:09:36] and widened and widened and uh and there is a sense that uh the commander-in-chief

[00:09:41] is not standing up for for the people below him talking with Ellen Moran

[00:09:45] of Emily's List this morning along with Peter till of the independent Institute

[00:09:48] we'd like you to join us this morning as well on the Washington Journal

[00:09:52] and if you'd like to do that you can call us if you're a Democrat

[00:09:56] 202 624 1111 if you're a

[00:10:00] republican it's 202 624 1115

[00:10:04] and if you're of some other political party

[00:10:09] 202-7372 437 please join us Mr

[00:10:12] till uh you have written a book as we mentioned before

[00:10:16] and uh you reside or you grew up in California do

[00:10:20] do you still get back there now and do you still that book The diversity

[00:10:24] myth we talked about was based on some experiences I believe at Stanford

[00:10:28] University so do you get back to Stanford often oh yes well I'm still I'm still in

[00:10:31] the area I still um I still talk on on the subject

[00:10:35] uh quite a bit I've been on a number of radio talk shows and and and and so on talking

[00:10:38] about the diversity myth our basic thesis is not that diversity

[00:10:42] is a bad thing I don't think any sane person would be against diversity per

[00:10:46] se but it is that you do not have real diversity when you have a

[00:10:49] group of people who look different but think alike and that the real

[00:10:53] problem in these debates about diversity is the incredible hypocrisy that

[00:10:57] uh that we have uh that we have diversity communities we have everybody

[00:11:00] trumping trumpeting diversity but uh but basically you

[00:11:04] have people who are all ideologically out of the same oldold and that's

[00:11:08] that's a very big problem I'd like to ask quickly and get Miss Moran's response

[00:11:12] uh your uh response to an article in the New York Times this morning multi-racial

[00:11:16] Americans ready to claim their own identity they're asking essentially for

[00:11:19] a separate category on the census well I I certainly

[00:11:23] think that uh that it's it's a big problem in the sense

[00:11:27] that this group identification um can go on and on and on

[00:11:30] and uh you know you could one of the things at Stanford that that there was a

[00:11:34] debate about was something called the half asian people's Association it was

[00:11:38] an organization set up for people of mixed Asian and

[00:11:41] uh American descent and uh and the question was

[00:11:45] did you need an organization like this was this was this constructive were half Asian

[00:11:49] peoples being oppressed marginalized and of course they went through the list and

[00:11:52] and they specifically argued that they were oppressed because they were not on the census

[00:11:56] forms do you do you do you think they should have a category or not I

[00:11:59] don't think I don't think it's it's possible to have categories for everybody I would

[00:12:03] actually move the other direction I think we should get rid of all racial

[00:12:07] categories I do think that there is an issue why should we have

[00:12:10] categories for people who are of one particular racial background and not

[00:12:14] people who are of mixed racial backgrounds that may be discriminatory but the way you solve

[00:12:18] the problem is by getting rid of all racial categories and

[00:12:21] you have to get in on this I don't but he keeps raising interesting points how

[00:12:25] do you how would you count the number of people and types of people in this country or would you

[00:12:29] I don't think that's something we should be counting I don't see why that's an important thing

[00:12:33] to be counting and I don't see why the government should be counting it well you know

[00:12:36] obviously uh I disagree with that I think that

[00:12:40] um and it's more it's not likely that that's going to happen that

[00:12:44] they would do away with um all racial categories

[00:12:47] but you know if as a society we're going to study what's going

[00:12:51] on in this country and how it affects various groups

[00:12:54] um you know what the United States census does

[00:12:58] track um are some of those issues I think

[00:13:02] it's important to you know to maintain that information I

[00:13:05] think that um furthermore more

[00:13:09] over time um other groups have

[00:13:13] introduced um you know different terminology different you

[00:13:16] know Asian Pacific Asian other um on the census

[00:13:20] and I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a multi-racial

[00:13:23] category added to the census um rather than pigeonhole people

[00:13:27] who are uncomfortable with one racial distinction or another um give them

[00:13:31] an opportunity to classify themselves as they wish to be classified

[00:13:34] I I I agree with you that descriptively it's very unlikely we're going to

[00:13:38] get rid of this uh racial categorization game anytime

[00:13:41] soon but I I do think that it's something we should not be

[00:13:45] not be playing anymore Watertown New York good morning good morning

[00:13:49] how are you fine how are you today fine even though I'm calling in on the Democratic

[00:13:53] line I I want to assure everyone that this is not a partisan comment

[00:13:56] I just happen to pick that because it was easy to get through uh I would

[00:14:00] like to comment on the uh tww uh disaster

[00:14:04] uh if we look at first of all the the purpose of terrorism assuming

[00:14:08] that it is and I believe that it is because of all the indications from my knowledge

[00:14:11] of explosives and what have you that you want to have the max the Maximum

[00:14:15] Impact uh to the greatest number of people that can can see

[00:14:19] it or witness it or know about it now they could have blown up the plane at the terminal

[00:14:23] but there that would have allowed investigators to have probably found a lot of things

[00:14:26] shown it was a bomb so what they elected to do was blow it up

[00:14:30] over the water but not too far out in the water

[00:14:34] where it would hamper uh any other people seeing it from the shoreline

[00:14:38] so I think that's why they picked that particular site the second part of my question

[00:14:42] is before you go through that New York let me ask you what's your knowledge

[00:14:45] you say you have knowledge of U explosives what's your knowledge of explosives

[00:14:49] well I spent 20 years in the Marine Corps and I've had a lot of chance to see landmines

[00:14:53] artillery shelves uh I was a Forward Air controller and aircraft I

[00:14:56] know what bombs look like when they go off and what have you have missile and Rockets and Etc

[00:15:00] so that's based upon that sure go ahead uh second point I wanted to make

[00:15:04] is uh and almost lost my thought there for a second sorry about that

[00:15:08] what the what the US's response will be I think this is critical

[00:15:12] uh not only the us but the entire world as it were

[00:15:16] because uh if it is a terrorist attack the response has to

[00:15:19] be indeed must be uh Swift severe

[00:15:23] and uh unified and that's my comment right of

[00:15:26] course uh I think that the response has to be Swift and

[00:15:30] forceful and unified um but uh

[00:15:34] first we need to determine whether or not there was in fact a bomb and certainly the authorities

[00:15:38] um as you alluded to earlier Peter are are um indicating more

[00:15:42] and more that that is uh that has been the case

[00:15:46] obviously as they assemble more clues find more facts about this

[00:15:50] I do believe that the response will be Swift

[00:15:54] I I have to say I'm I'm rather skeptical whether the response is going to be swift

[00:15:58] at all if you look at what happened with the uh um tww bombing

[00:16:02] in 1988 for example which was I guess eight eight eight years

[00:16:06] ago almost now um over lockerby in Scotland

[00:16:09] um they they they did actually identify the terrorists they're in Libya um they're still

[00:16:13] in Libya and uh and basically we we have a list of governments

[00:16:17] around the world that are sponsoring terrorism um we have uh Syria

[00:16:21] we have Libya you have Sudan Iran North Korea two

[00:16:24] or three others and our response has been extremely limmited the

[00:16:28] the real problem is that there is not so much the government can do about these things and that's

[00:16:32] that's uh we always like to say that there's something we can do to solve these problems but unfortunately

[00:16:36] there's not all that much the government um is capable of doing or is willing

[00:16:39] to do Tucson Arizona oh yes

[00:16:43] um I was reading the Weekly Standard this week and I was really devastated

[00:16:46] when I read something uh about an internal memo going from John Boehner

[00:16:50] to Republicans concerning the partial birth abortion B

[00:16:54] um it seems to me that the Republicans are just as disingenuous

[00:16:58] as the Liberals are uh when when he can send a memo

[00:17:02] to the people that are for the ban and explaining to

[00:17:05] their con constituents why they are and on the other hand

[00:17:09] um to the people that are against it and and saying

[00:17:13] well this is this is a good opportunity to um explain to your

[00:17:17] constituents and and draw more people in it just seems that nobody has

[00:17:20] any really base like I read Roger Mars's book and I almost believe

[00:17:24] he's right that they're all bought and paid for especially when you see what happened in Saudi Arabia

[00:17:28] my son was there a couple of years ago in Rian and you know we're still

[00:17:31] dependent on foreign oil and why and it just kind

[00:17:35] of you know knocks kind of knocks the wind out of myself to say gee

[00:17:38] you know I I like these Republicans and what they were doing and trying to give

[00:17:42] um power back to the States and I still agree with that but it just bothers

[00:17:46] me that nobody that there's very few people that you really can trust like

[00:17:49] I trust John McCain and maybe a handful of freshmen and and that's it I think the

[00:17:53] rest of them are all bought and paid for and I'm really sorry to see

[00:17:56] that uh well to address your initial concern about the partial

[00:18:00] birth abortion ban I think that this debate is over a procedure that is extremely

[00:18:04] rare and used only in the most dire of circumstances

[00:18:09] um and I guess that's well uh let me just

[00:18:13] address your your point about the uh the political um the

[00:18:16] question of how how these political Representatives work I I think

[00:18:20] gen generally a very good rule is um is to trust in

[00:18:23] ideas not in people and uh and certainly one of

[00:18:27] the big problems with a lot of political candidates is that they don't really have a

[00:18:31] lot of principles uh and I think you know we can make

[00:18:34] a CA very strong case about that with respect to both Clinton and Dole it's it's sort of

[00:18:38] this political game you try to read the read the polls and it's like we're

[00:18:42] electing someone who's the best poll taker in the US um and certainly

[00:18:45] I think that was what animated that memo on the partial birth

[00:18:49] abortion San Antonio Texas good morning how are you doing

[00:18:52] fine how are you I had a comment it was an article in our paper to

[00:18:56] San Antonio Express News about Bob Dole's

[00:19:00] plan for school vouchers and and the like

[00:19:04] and you know he talks trying to act like he's going to be the education

[00:19:09] president I believe President Bush did that and if you

[00:19:12] look at Dole's record from the past you know he voted against head

[00:19:16] in 1965 in the school lunch program

[00:19:20] and he voted against head start again in 1996 and he voted

[00:19:24] against drug you know safe drug free zones around

[00:19:27] schools I was wondering do you think that he has Tau

[00:19:31] pre does he practice what he preaches or is he just preaching

[00:19:35] is he preaching Miss Moran I think that

[00:19:39] there's been a real concerted effort on the part of the Dole campaign

[00:19:43] to um craft message and

[00:19:46] language around um you know popular ideas

[00:19:50] he has obviously a very long history in the Senate um he has

[00:19:54] invited the opposition to look at that record and you're exactly

[00:19:57] right he did vote against Head Start um he

[00:20:02] uh voted against Medicare I mean he voted he's voted in

[00:20:05] the past against a lot of programs that the American people care about

[00:20:09] um you know and there's obviously a distinctive move to move him to

[00:20:13] the center in this election year it's not surprising at all in my mind

[00:20:17] well I'm not sure I'm that worried about Dole's votes against uh Head Start programs

[00:20:21] like that the record is very mixed these programs do not appear to have been terribly successful

[00:20:25] I do think this has been the most one of the most interesting initiatives of the do

[00:20:29] campaign has been the school voucher initiative it is sort of the

[00:20:32] the one major new idea in in public education

[00:20:36] in the last uh 10 years is to make the process competitive to open it up

[00:20:40] uh to make schools compete and and that way to try to improve them

[00:20:43] not to try to have some top- down federally mandated approach like

[00:20:47] Head Start or drug-free school zones or national standards or

[00:20:51] whatever you want but instead to try to have a bottomup approach where

[00:20:54] where you let uh different ideas be tried in different school districts you see what works

[00:20:58] people learn from each other and that way gradually things might get better talking

[00:21:02] with Ellen Moran of Emily's List which by the way is

[00:21:06] hyperlink to c-span's homepage and the way that that works

[00:21:10] is if you click on uh our homepage

[00:21:13] you'll get some Emily's List information today and I'm

[00:21:17] if I'm wrong about that correct me I was briefed on this and I have

[00:21:21] recently delved into the computer World myself at home

[00:21:24] so if I'm wrong correct me but I don't think so Peter till wrote the

[00:21:28] divers myth he's also a research fellow at the independent

[00:21:32] Institute um and we are talking with them

[00:21:35] about today's news we'd like you for you to join us and I think nework

[00:21:39] Arkansas new ark Arkansas is next on

[00:21:43] the phones good morning new ark uh yes

[00:21:47] uh I was calling I'm a firsttime caller so I'm a little bit nervous

[00:21:51] don't be nervous just relax like the rest of us okay

[00:21:56] um last week in uh Arkansas Democrat

[00:22:00] Gazette uh there was a lot of uh

[00:22:04] hoopla about Jim guy Tucker and

[00:22:08] he was uh he resigned and then

[00:22:11] he decided not to resign and the

[00:22:15] lieuten lieutenant governor was a

[00:22:19] he's a Republican and they kind of

[00:22:23] jerked him around there for a few days and and

[00:22:27] he was going to be impeached or and

[00:22:30] threatened to and I was wondering why the national

[00:22:34] media didn't get in on that

[00:22:38] well um well I don't I guess it was an Arkansas based

[00:22:41] story of course Arkansas has been of some interest because

[00:22:45] there's the Clinton link and there's a sense that things that are going on in Arkansas

[00:22:49] are important because of the Clinton Administration and there is

[00:22:52] of course the perception of media bias that a lot of people are are not

[00:22:56] really interested in probing Clinton's background all that much precisely

[00:22:59] because uh because there's a lot probably in Arkansas that's rather

[00:23:03] fishy what what I think is always is interesting is is precisely how different

[00:23:07] Arkansas really is from a lot of other states in the US I mean

[00:23:10] just what you've read in the newspapers over the last couple of years what we've learned about Arkansas

[00:23:14] is it's almost like a Banana Republic uh with you know a lot of poor people

[00:23:17] a small middle class and and this this wealthy Elite that basically

[00:23:21] runs the uh runs the political process and and controls the state

[00:23:25] government and sort of Dos out government funds to it

[00:23:29] self uh I'm not sure if the caller's question uh was

[00:23:33] aimed directly at uh whether or not there was national news

[00:23:36] play When You referred to a national link but I can assure you there was quite a bit

[00:23:40] of national news play up here on uh uh

[00:23:43] Governor Tuckers um uh

[00:23:47] indecision I guess um over the course of that day

[00:23:51] uh and obviously I think most people think that it was very poor form

[00:23:55] he made a decision to resign he then uh went

[00:23:58] on uh to think maybe I won't resign and then you know

[00:24:02] had to basically uh be told by the lieutenant governor and

[00:24:05] other Democratic leaders in the state that in fact you know you will

[00:24:09] be impeached if you don't resign and so um you know that

[00:24:13] did get serious National play um how that kind of behavior

[00:24:17] reflects on the president I I think is uh

[00:24:21] you know it's not Bill Clinton's fault that uh you know he

[00:24:24] went through these flip-flops over the course of a very

[00:24:28] crying news day well I agree with you uh Bill Clinton is not responsible for

[00:24:32] everything that goes wrong in this country okay

[00:24:35] we've got that straight now now um you have a

[00:24:39] a homepage too and you're hyperlink to C-SPAN

[00:24:43] as well and um I'd like for both of you if you will

[00:24:46] to tell us what well there they are you know I'd like for you to give us your

[00:24:50] addresses if you know them if you don't we'll just let the folks in the in the

[00:24:54] the other offices deal with it well I I believe our our address is

[00:24:58] uh worldwide web at independent.com

[00:25:01] okay and uh I'm sorry I don't know

[00:25:05] what our email address is I think it might be uh

[00:25:09] www HT

[00:25:12] Emily's list.org I think at any rate um

[00:25:16] both their pages are hyperlink to c-span's um homepage

[00:25:20] and if you click on cpan today you'll get information about both of these

[00:25:24] uh groups the independent Institute and Emily's List let's go to

[00:25:27] Daytona Beach Florida good morning good morning how are you

[00:25:31] fine how are you good sir I'm um looking at a piece on the oped

[00:25:35] page in the uh datona Beach News Journal uh dole is gop's

[00:25:39] Whipping Boy and it caught my attention because I was listening

[00:25:43] to talk radio yesterday and um

[00:25:47] a right right-wing uh talk show host is talking

[00:25:51] about um the possibility of n Gingrich and other

[00:25:55] Republican heavyweights uh sitting down with Mr Dole and um

[00:25:59] talking about the possibility of his withdrawing from the race and throwing this thing

[00:26:03] open in November and uh this piece here this

[00:26:06] morning is almost suggesting the same thing and I not heard a comment

[00:26:10] on it I think the man's a fine man we're into this you know quite a

[00:26:13] ways it just shocked me and I was want a comment

[00:26:17] from get let's go with Miss Moran

[00:26:21] first well I think that clearly you know that the news

[00:26:24] media um has been reporting some real inner factions that are

[00:26:28] very they're very deep chasms within the Republican party you can see it in

[00:26:32] the um platform fight you can see it I mean in the

[00:26:36] Washington Times on the front page today there was a story on

[00:26:39] GOP convention lineup seen as wooing liberals with a whole host of

[00:26:44] um Republican Party leaders um bashing the nominee for

[00:26:48] his choice of um General Coen pel and representative Susan

[00:26:51] Molinari in um major visible roles in the

[00:26:55] convention um you know the the GOP

[00:26:59] uh is not unified there are uh huge

[00:27:03] arguments going on within the leadership of the GOP I don't know that

[00:27:07] that'll wind up resulting in uh dole being asked to step down

[00:27:10] in fact I doubt that but uh it is indicative of

[00:27:14] um of a party that just can't seem to get its act together um

[00:27:18] to try to wage a successful campaign well I do think there are some

[00:27:21] deep divisions in the Republican Party there're also very deep divisions in in the Democratic

[00:27:25] party it's probably a symptom of any large political party I I would

[00:27:29] say the reason they are being so exacerbated right now is of course

[00:27:33] uh that that Dole does not have a message himself he doesn't really know

[00:27:36] what he wants to say there doesn't seem to be any PR guiding principle it seems

[00:27:40] to all be sort of this personality driven campaign and Dole does not come across as

[00:27:44] a GI Kinder and gentler candidate certainly so that's it's not a very good

[00:27:47] strategy for the do campaign and when there's no no principled message

[00:27:51] the default is that a lot of other people go go out and try to Define it and that's why you're having

[00:27:54] a lot of these disputes let's go to Austin Texas good morning good

[00:27:58] morning how are you fine how are you good what's on your mind

[00:28:02] well I have been listening to the news in the last couple of weeks hoping

[00:28:06] to hear uh further about a story that I heard just briefly

[00:28:10] and that was um a story about a woman who was jailed

[00:28:15] for calling out to the president and I'm quoting you

[00:28:18] suck okay and I haven't seen anything in the news about that

[00:28:22] story and I I even called CNN the um program

[00:28:26] the headline news if you will

[00:28:30] hold tight we have there is some news about that today in

[00:28:33] fact it's in the Washington Post um I'll find it very quickly and

[00:28:37] uh tell you what it says because it's very short and if you have a question

[00:28:41] you can uh address that question essentially the article

[00:28:44] is entitled we can show this here

[00:28:49] disorderly menacing or just rude and this is written by Edward Walsh

[00:28:53] um what this basically goes to today is that there is some

[00:28:58] dispute over who's said what and how it was said I'll

[00:29:01] read a a brief portion to you as Clinton sampled the food wears at a

[00:29:05] booth um this was at the Taste of Chicago Festival Camden

[00:29:09] said and this is a police officer or uh rather uh

[00:29:13] someone who yeah police officer said uh the mendozas

[00:29:16] were in close proximity yelling obscenities like you suck and words that rhyme

[00:29:20] with suck as Clinton was leaving the park according to Camden Patricia Mendoza

[00:29:24] was overheard to say you suck and you ought to die or words to that

[00:29:27] effect it was then that a secret service agent began to question

[00:29:31] Mendoza to clarify her intentions and according to this person

[00:29:34] Camden that woman with her husband became loud abusive profane drawing

[00:29:38] a larger and larger crowd and that is the latest development

[00:29:42] on that and Patrick Camden is with the Chicago Police

[00:29:46] so so do you have a question comment

[00:29:50] well it it sounded like and I'm not sure it sounds like she

[00:29:54] was arrested for speaking

[00:29:58] okay what she said it doesn't sound like she actually did

[00:30:02] anything okay and isn't that

[00:30:05] um I mean basically isn't she being uh jailed

[00:30:09] for speaking her mind we'll defer to Our Guest Mr

[00:30:13] Mr teal well I I guess um I guess I

[00:30:17] it's it's hard to know exactly what's going on certainly if you if you threaten the president's life

[00:30:20] that is uh that is normally a pretty bad thing and and it's never

[00:30:24] really clear whether that's merely speech or whether you're actually serious

[00:30:28] uh serious about that what I think is somewhat interesting about it is

[00:30:31] if she was in fact just speaking of sort of the the terminology you use like you

[00:30:35] suck things like this um and what's interesting about is of course this

[00:30:38] is not I I don't think this is what people would have said about the president 20 30 years

[00:30:42] ago there's been this tremendous loss of dignity loss of stature of the

[00:30:46] presidential office in the last couple of years and and uh I'm not sure whether

[00:30:49] it has anything to do with the current occupant or whether it's it's something that's a

[00:30:53] more General thing happening in sort of increasing coarseness in American

[00:30:57] society but uh um well this is funny that you would

[00:31:00] bring up this article because this is an article I I chose um cuz I thought

[00:31:04] it was actually kind of funny I mean the Secret Service who has never been

[00:31:09] um portrayed as big fans of Bill Clinton um took

[00:31:12] this woman aside um and questioned her because if you do threaten

[00:31:16] the president or tell the president that you want or wish that they

[00:31:19] would die that's a federal offense and I think that we have to trust the Secret Service

[00:31:23] to do their job and you know the the news talk uh

[00:31:27] hosts and Bon G Gordon ly have um

[00:31:30] uh moved forward to try to make this some kind of free speech issue

[00:31:35] and you know uh regardless of whether or not she threatened the

[00:31:38] president I think she was arrested for uh you know loud and disorderly

[00:31:43] conduct after heckling and screaming for 15 minutes in almost

[00:31:46] any public forum you'd probably be taken away and so I think that there's a

[00:31:50] real misassignment here of what this issue is really about whether or not it's you

[00:31:53] know a free speech issue you know certainly Everyone's entitled to their opinions

[00:31:57] however you know if you that involves threatening the president then you are going to be

[00:32:00] taken away and you should be any comment on that

[00:32:04] um I I think that's I'll leave it at that yeah the um

[00:32:08] the issue of free speech is something that's been pretty

[00:32:11] pretty uh prominent recently and as as the campaign

[00:32:16] probably grows closer to us it will be more I'm wondering

[00:32:19] if either of you has any suggestions about uh what the Secret

[00:32:23] Service should do because this kind of thing might happen more often um

[00:32:27] as we approach the campaign season closer to the campaign season

[00:32:31] well I I I I do think I do think speech should generally be tolerated

[00:32:34] I think I think this this is sort of the exception that proves the rule in a sense

[00:32:38] it's the exception because you actually were threatening someone's life but but

[00:32:42] absent that sort of uh threat I think we have to tolerate free speech

[00:32:46] I think that we're a worse Society if we do not have a pretty rigid

[00:32:50] uh tolerance of of free speech across the board

[00:32:53] you agree I agree with that um the the

[00:32:57] sort of outcome though of this President is that you know this President likes to

[00:33:00] get in among the people and um is

[00:33:04] uh at his best when he's um one-on-one in small groups

[00:33:08] greeting crowds at the Taste of Chicago you know I'm sure

[00:33:11] he was visiting booths and there were you know people in very close proximity

[00:33:15] and so while I do think we need to be for free speech I do think that again we

[00:33:18] need to let the Secret Service do their job and if they think that there's reason

[00:33:22] to uh pull somebody away because you know the president

[00:33:26] could be in some sort of trouble um we need to support them in doing

[00:33:29] that Tampa Florida good morning good morning

[00:33:33] how are you just fine how are you today just fine thank you

[00:33:37] there have been other cases where he has uh where President Clinton

[00:33:40] has certainly been accused of quieting people there was a case where

[00:33:44] he was going to speak to a college uh student body

[00:33:48] and there was a young man who represented a large portion of the uh

[00:33:52] I believe it was The Graduate School in that particular

[00:33:56] college and he uh was approved to

[00:33:59] ask questions until after they found out that he was uh

[00:34:03] more uh conservative than they wished and he was not allowed

[00:34:07] to ask the questions at that point I am terribly

[00:34:11] concerned about freedom of speech and I think with you young

[00:34:14] people I am in my 60s and I feel like that you young people certainly

[00:34:18] should be concerned about some of the things that are going on

[00:34:22] now and um I'm sorry I'm a little bit nervous it's

[00:34:25] okay just relax but I have I am concerned about the

[00:34:29] way our country is going I do not like uh these

[00:34:33] things that are being hushed up

[00:34:36] and I also feel like that y'all ought to be concerned please look into

[00:34:40] it please be concerned because our freedoms are very very important to

[00:34:44] us and I think that there have been so many things that this

[00:34:48] particular uh Administration has done that they

[00:34:51] are not deserving the same kind of respect that we've had for our presences

[00:34:55] in the past thank you very much

[00:34:59] uh well I I don't know a lot of uh information about the incident in Florida that

[00:35:03] the caller is referring to but um you know again I

[00:35:06] would underscore that you know freedom of speech is uh is

[00:35:10] perhaps or arguably the most important right that we have in this country we have a

[00:35:13] facts here from M Robinson at St Francis College I'm curious as

[00:35:17] to whether Mr teal is willing to be as cynical about Paula Jones's

[00:35:20] allegation as he is about the academy incident it seems that many Republicans

[00:35:24] are willing to take the ball and run whenever someone makes an accusation

[00:35:28] towards some alleged wrongdoing by the president while not being at all

[00:35:32] curious about propriety about the propriety it should

[00:35:35] say of Senator damato's involved in hearing hearings against the president

[00:35:39] while being at the top of the Dole campaign it seems that at least at the

[00:35:43] very least damato should recuse himself from his chairmanship

[00:35:46] of the Dole campaign until matters are settled any response well

[00:35:50] I uh I guess there are two different issues that are raised there I think as far as the Paula Jones

[00:35:54] case goes I I I I am somewhat skeptical of the case there

[00:35:57] I mean it's it's uh it is it is not clear that uh that

[00:36:01] uh she was really coerced it looks like there was a lot of different

[00:36:05] stuff going on of course in some ways the issue with the Paula Jones case is

[00:36:08] not really a question of sexual harassment it's more a question of Clinton's

[00:36:12] sexual conduct and whether he was faithful to his wife things of

[00:36:15] that sort uh um that's sort of the larger political question that

[00:36:19] underlies why there's so much focus on that particular case but certainly I

[00:36:22] think the sexual harassment charge is is very odd what's interesting of course

[00:36:26] is that the double standard really cuts the other way that uh that a lot of people who are

[00:36:30] extremely concerned about sexual harassment and have sort of made this into a crusade

[00:36:34] are not all that concerned about the Paula Jones case let's go to Miami good

[00:36:37] morning good morning I've got a nonpartisan

[00:36:41] issue here that outrages me Miami Herold

[00:36:45] this morning has a story the headline reads children

[00:36:48] of Japanese repatriated in World War Two may get

[00:36:52] cash now as a World War II veteran this really

[00:36:56] turns me off because these are children of the

[00:37:00] 2400 Japanese diplomats that we intered at

[00:37:03] the beginning of the war under international law a number of them

[00:37:07] had uh infant children that were born in the United States while

[00:37:11] they were here on duty they were exchanged on the Swedish liner

[00:37:15] grips Home for American prisoners sent back from the

[00:37:18] from Japan under similar circumstances now the justice

[00:37:22] department has decided that these people are uh

[00:37:26] are victims of human suffering and they want to amend

[00:37:30] the Japanese money Bill of 1988 to include

[00:37:34] these children who were repatriated who are also Japanese citizens

[00:37:38] dual citizenship you know and to give them $220,000

[00:37:42] each to the tune of 2,500,000 bucks

[00:37:45] of our taxpayers money this is an outrage to me and

[00:37:49] uh I just wonder what you folks think about it if you'd ever heard about it

[00:37:53] thank you very much thank you Peter to well I I I couldn't

[00:37:56] agree with the or more I think it is I think it is an outrage I think that there

[00:38:00] are some real victims and there are some people who are not real victims and pretend to be

[00:38:04] victims and I think this is sort of the latest in that sort of thing where people

[00:38:07] use their victim status as a proverbial stick with which to beat other people

[00:38:11] over the head or or even more directly to to get money from the government

[00:38:14] Ellen Mor any comment well you know aside from uh cash award

[00:38:18] to people who have dual citizenship which is news to me

[00:38:22] um you know the Japanese internment most Americans agree

[00:38:26] was wrong um and uh you know to inter turn

[00:38:29] people who were American citizens um in you know almost

[00:38:33] concentration camp like uh surroundings during uh that

[00:38:37] war was not the right course of action and the US government does have a responsibility

[00:38:41] to apologize and admit that that was the wrong thing to do

[00:38:45] um you know cash Awards I don't know St Louis good morning

[00:38:49] good morning uh I just wanted to make a comment first about

[00:38:53] the uh General uh state of society Mr teal

[00:38:56] mentioned uh the president or people uh

[00:39:00] uh being rude or Etc uh it seemed to me that that's

[00:39:04] nothing to do with the presidency it's to do with the society uh

[00:39:08] I recall that uh Mr Reagan took the blame when Beirut

[00:39:12] Barracks were all blown up there weren't any hearings nobody yelled at him

[00:39:16] uh and uh for a guy who ran that he was going to instantly

[00:39:20] strike and get it everybody who did anything to us

[00:39:24] uh nothing has ever happened from that incident so the people who call

[00:39:27] in that we should do this and that right away as soon as we find out

[00:39:31] uh they'll blame the president of course but never think that the same thing

[00:39:35] happened before um the other comment I just make

[00:39:39] about that incident in Chicago uh as usual

[00:39:42] it seems that the first thing out of the box the the talk show hosts

[00:39:46] have to uh have to uh get on it it's the president

[00:39:49] it's this it's that it's free speech this uh lady living in

[00:39:53] fear that just called in uh from somewhere in the South I gather

[00:39:57] uh is worried about her freedoms she seems to forget that Mr

[00:40:00] Nixon ran a whole campaign with uh people sitting in an

[00:40:04] audience who were handpicked uh nobody got in that had any kind

[00:40:08] of question that uh wasn't a softball that he could handle

[00:40:12] uh and talking about some guy in Florida some student

[00:40:16] just seems a little odd to me uh

[00:40:19] I think free speech is Alive and Well in the United States

[00:40:23] if uh if anything there's more of it today than there's ever been

[00:40:27] thank you thank you well I let me just make another comment on the

[00:40:30] sort of the emerging presidential campaign I I think I think there's there's a

[00:40:34] mistake a lot of people are making which is to focus on it a little bit too much the

[00:40:38] the presidential campaign is is sort of uh sort of like what Shakespeare said it's a

[00:40:42] it's this the 196 I think is particularly true it's it's like a tale told by an idiot

[00:40:46] full of Sound and Fury signifying nothing and uh and I do think

[00:40:50] as I said before it's a mistake to blame President Clinton or for that matter Hillary

[00:40:53] Clinton for everything that's wrong in the United States at the same time it's a

[00:40:57] serious mistake to think that these people are capable of solving all

[00:41:01] the problems in this country and that's sort of why the two things go together we blame

[00:41:04] them for everything that's wrong because we assume if they just did things right

[00:41:08] they could solve all these problems and I think we should be a little bit more skeptical about what

[00:41:11] government can do and what some of its real limits are in solving some of

[00:41:15] the problems our society faces next ttic or did you want to make a

[00:41:19] comment um well you know I was yeah I was sure I was

[00:41:22] uh just going to say that I think you're right you know

[00:41:26] certainly the Office of the President pres can't solve every problem um in the country but

[00:41:29] this president has made some efforts to strengthen families and make things

[00:41:33] uh easier on families um to build a strong family

[00:41:37] and uh you know raise their children in an environment that

[00:41:41] uh you know in which they will be successful um

[00:41:44] and uh the the halalu in in News Talk Radio would

[00:41:48] have you believe that uh that that is not the case

[00:41:51] right um I I don't disagree that he's made an effort to do these things I think I think the more

[00:41:55] difficult question is is whether whether any such effort will actually

[00:41:59] bear fruit whether there is anything that can be done from Washington DC to strengthen

[00:42:02] families or local communities or or what have you

[00:42:07] let's go to East Orange New Jersey while you're looking for your next articles East Orange

[00:42:10] good morning good morning how you doing just fine how are you today

[00:42:14] okay I'm calling in reference to the article you referred to in the

[00:42:18] I believe it was the Miami Herald about the new category for biracial

[00:42:22] folks no that was actually uh the New York Times

[00:42:26] this morning York Times great then I then I'll get a copy of that uh

[00:42:30] my problem is I'm an African-American I'm represent probably some

[00:42:33] African-Americans who think that this is a further

[00:42:37] attempt in this conservative environment to weaken

[00:42:41] the political strength of the African-American Community

[00:42:44] uh by if in fact this becomes a

[00:42:48] problem or if in fact this goes through then

[00:42:53] in this in this in in view of the fact that we live in a very racist

[00:42:56] Society General it's going to further destroy the political power

[00:43:00] of the African-American community and that's and I'll hang up and listen to your comments

[00:43:04] thanks New Jersey either I know it's a concern

[00:43:08] um in the African American community and you know certainly

[00:43:11] a valid one uh but I think that

[00:43:15] you know in a society where we afford people you know the choice of

[00:43:19] how to define themselves or how to you know uh articulate

[00:43:22] themselves they ought to be able to um you know indicate

[00:43:26] on a census form or when asked or refer to themselves in conversations

[00:43:30] in everyday life um however they wish and

[00:43:34] um you know I I think uh that's

[00:43:38] going to have to be the way it is well I I I agree that people should have a choice

[00:43:41] in terms of how they identify themselves and I I don't think group identification is

[00:43:45] ever a good thing but if people want to identify themselves as part of a group I think they have

[00:43:49] that that's their perfect right I think it's much more of a concern when you have the

[00:43:52] US government defining the groups and encouraging

[00:43:56] people to divide themselves along group lines and again I think the solution to this

[00:43:59] has to be to get rid of all racial categories on these fors not to start including

[00:44:04] a whole bunch of new categories because there's no end to categories we could list

[00:44:07] I think what you're seeing in this um in these articles though um and there was

[00:44:11] one in the post just yesterday is that the movement is not coming from the

[00:44:15] government it's coming from the people um you know they both articles interview

[00:44:18] people who are relieved in fact to be able to have a broader category

[00:44:22] to you know identify themselves with and you know you would like

[00:44:26] to you know not have people identify themselves with groups but people do want

[00:44:29] to identify themselves with groups so I think we should allow for that

[00:44:33] we have a fact here cpan guest Nazi Olympics Berlin 96

[00:44:37] twice I've seen C-SPAN show the Holocaust Museum and

[00:44:42] it's Nazi Olympic display it appeared to me that rather than this

[00:44:45] museum being in DC it should be in Germany furthermore it's my understanding

[00:44:49] that American taxpayers have federally budget 20 budgeted $ 27

[00:44:53] million for this Museum what is of more concern is that the land

[00:44:56] of the Museum sits on was publicly donated and at the same time

[00:45:00] is a private Foundation we won't uh have an opportunity

[00:45:04] to read the whole facts we will be uh bringing you

[00:45:07] a tour of the Holocaust Museum's

[00:45:11] um Olympics 36 Olympics Nazi Olympics

[00:45:15] in about 10 minutes and at that point time we'll take some questions

[00:45:19] at that point time so maybe we'll be able to solve any concerns about it at

[00:45:22] that point in time in the meantime we're talking with Ellen Moran of Emily's List

[00:45:26] and Peter H independent Institute let's go to pasor Gula Mississippi

[00:45:30] good morning pasor Gula you there

[00:45:34] you're there pasor Gul yes sir good morning good morning

[00:45:38] the uh and and and my

[00:45:41] father had worked with the with he's been in the press all his life

[00:45:45] my question is uh do y'all feel

[00:45:49] that the uh press

[00:45:53] possibly not cover up per se but when

[00:45:56] it comes to uh wrongdoings or something

[00:46:00] to extent the Republicans and Democrats there's there's

[00:46:04] there's maybe maybe more of a a liberal help to the

[00:46:07] Democrat Party could you rephrase that

[00:46:11] question sir let me make it simpler I'm sorry as

[00:46:14] far as things per se

[00:46:18] Watergate uh subjects like that that the

[00:46:22] um Democrats if they their wrongdoings or

[00:46:25] maybe uh less covered on TV newspaper

[00:46:29] any media than the Republican Party okay

[00:46:33] well it's it's it's really hard to it's really hard to actually judge to what extent

[00:46:37] wrongdoings are covered to what extent they compare it's it's extremely difficult to make these

[00:46:40] sorts of Assessments it is true that uh the mainstream media is

[00:46:44] quite Lial you have these polls that are consistently taken that show

[00:46:47] you know that the vast majority of of people identify themselves on the left

[00:46:51] or the liberal end of the political Spectrum work in in the major media groups

[00:46:55] uh it's an interesting question to what ENT uh they are able to sort of transcend

[00:46:58] their particular biases in covering the news well I don't know I've seen some of the

[00:47:02] most liberal or supposedly liberal um

[00:47:06] members of the news media go after Democrats almost bending over

[00:47:10] backwards to you know to to treat the issue fairly and so far

[00:47:13] as the Press coverage is concerned of you know Democratic wrongdoing doings versus

[00:47:17] Republican um wrongdoings I think that the um

[00:47:21] you know the media reports both evenly I mean you know

[00:47:24] conflict or Scandal or wrongdoing is a story in the news media and

[00:47:29] you know their job is to report what's interesting to the people and you know

[00:47:32] I think that they do that accurately and I think we have to you know

[00:47:36] cut them a little slack for being professionals well I also think the media is a competitive industry

[00:47:40] uh it's more competitive than ideological perhaps and so uh if there are

[00:47:44] newspapers that do not cover important stories well people are not going to read those newspapers

[00:47:47] people are going to read the newspapers that cover the news and that's why that's why I think we still have a

[00:47:51] pretty pretty free press in this country okay here's a

[00:47:55] question any more articles well I had one one other

[00:47:59] one other article was um was the uh top Bosnian

[00:48:02] Serb agrees to resign and the whole the whole Bosnia episode uh

[00:48:06] and of course what I what I think the the larger theme

[00:48:09] behind that story is is that it looks like uh it looks like we may

[00:48:13] have peace in Bosnia but we're not going to have Justice and uh and it's sort of

[00:48:17] this it's this interesting problem you know after after the one one caller was uh

[00:48:20] was faing about the Nazi Holocaust at the time people vowed that

[00:48:24] we would never let this happen again we would never again allow a government to

[00:48:29] fight against its own people and yet you know it has happened over and over and

[00:48:32] over again it's happened it happened in maois China it happened in campuchia

[00:48:36] under the C Rouge uh it's happening in Sudan right now with

[00:48:40] Christians in the the south of Sudan and of course it happened in Bosnia it happened

[00:48:43] in Rwanda Bundi you can go down the list and uh and so I I think

[00:48:47] that uh I think that even though we sort of have papered over this peace

[00:48:51] process on a governmental level it has not really uh not really solved

[00:48:54] any of the underlying problems well my understanding is that the war criminals in

[00:48:58] in Bosnia are being tried and this is why this um

[00:49:02] this guy is stepping down and you know I think you can make an argument that we should

[00:49:05] have gotten involved earlier um certainly what uh happened in Bosnia

[00:49:09] is an atrocity and it is uh it is right up

[00:49:13] there with some of the most um you know egregious things that have happened in our world's

[00:49:17] history and uh you know but I do think that working

[00:49:20] towards peace is a productive Endeavor and I think you know H Brook going back over there to try

[00:49:24] to broker something that would work um you know it's been an important

[00:49:28] step because the American people have you know started to think that this is

[00:49:31] uh you know that peace we need to be involved in the peace process

[00:49:35] in Bosnia Miami Florida good morning good morning um my

[00:49:38] uh I'm calling about the um article about the Japanese

[00:49:43] um paying the money to the Japanese the Recreations this is the Miami

[00:49:47] Herald hello yes okay okay uh my opinion

[00:49:50] about that if they do that why don't they pay the Native Americans and blacks

[00:49:54] for slav slavery okay Mr

[00:49:58] teal well that's a good question I don't think there's actually a good answer

[00:50:01] to that I think that certainly uh if you want to talk about uh paying

[00:50:05] blacks or African-Americans or Native Americans uh you have a much more compelling

[00:50:09] case than uh than uh than the descendants of people who were who were

[00:50:13] interned uh and I I I really think there's no limit to this you know you can

[00:50:16] ask why shouldn't we be paying you know um why shouldn't we be paying

[00:50:20] all these groups of people people who are who are um who are exploited

[00:50:24] by capitalists in the 19th century why shouldn't we be paying people who

[00:50:27] got a bad public school education why shouldn't we be paying reparations

[00:50:31] to people whose parents didn't treat them properly when they were growing up and I think

[00:50:35] I think the problem is once again there is there are no political

[00:50:38] solutions for certain types of problems there is not a remedy for every

[00:50:42] y Maran she doesn't want to touch that

[00:50:46] okay um Wilmington Vermont is next good

[00:50:49] morning hi good morning how are you yes uh

[00:50:53] this is George in Wilmington Vermont and uh looking at the

[00:50:57] bias of the press matter of fact Wolf Blitzer was the only

[00:51:00] individual that actually questioned the president as to the

[00:51:04] cuts that the Republicans were giving

[00:51:08] us and there were not Cuts there were increases I'm a

[00:51:11] senior citizen they are increasing my uh Medicare

[00:51:16] they're increasing a lot of different things that uh that the Press has

[00:51:19] not reported that out there the other things else too is that

[00:51:23] every each time you see something to do with uh Clinton

[00:51:27] uh uh situation about the about

[00:51:30] the papers where one of those uh files that

[00:51:34] man uh back in Watergate went to prison for looking at

[00:51:37] one file and yet he has uh 700 and something

[00:51:41] that's been exposed and also too is the fact that

[00:51:45] that not one person okay knows who hired

[00:51:49] Livingston and you know there's so many other things that I can go on and I

[00:51:52] say to myself I say how come that this person

[00:51:56] myself it was a once a Democrat okay that voted for

[00:51:59] John F Kennedy and voted for the supply side of in

[00:52:03] you know cutting taxes like he did why doesn't

[00:52:07] Clinton look at what uh dragan did and

[00:52:10] what Kennedy did for the better portion of our country and you know

[00:52:14] I just want to make a f comments that uh we are are in

[00:52:18] a real problem look at these five things that knocked out

[00:52:21] 19 out of 22 civilizations and you young people there

[00:52:25] will be considering this very very much number one on the list

[00:52:28] is inflation number two crooked politics number

[00:52:32] three is this uh you know divorce number four

[00:52:36] is mysticism there santaria you know devil worship and astrology

[00:52:39] and all that stuff and then the last thing on there is if

[00:52:43] it feels good do it the morality I'm 64 years

[00:52:47] old the things that are going on in this country now were never considered

[00:52:50] when I was a younger person people have to get on a ball

[00:52:54] thank you thank you very much and your respon either

[00:52:58] well initially I don't think we need to worry about um the news

[00:53:01] media Under reporting um you know file gate right

[00:53:05] now um you know the media is obsessed with it so um

[00:53:09] you know these questions that he asked are being um explored

[00:53:12] in a very public way and you know we'll see what the facts are so far there's really

[00:53:17] uh I mean there's been an open discourse about this and so we'll see

[00:53:21] two uh yeah well it's interesting that he mentioned both Medicare and file gate

[00:53:24] on you know a superficial level you think these are two totally different things on the one hand you have this massive

[00:53:28] Medicare uh program on the other hand you have this sort of file gate which

[00:53:32] is it seems like sort of a sid show in a circus but uh

[00:53:36] but I think there's actually some connection between the two and I think it is worth exploring file

[00:53:39] gate quite a bit more because if you have a white house that can't even

[00:53:43] administer its own internal files how could they possibly run the Health

[00:53:47] Care system for the country as a whole uh how could the executive branch possibly

[00:53:50] do a good job doing that and I think that's the that's the bigger political question that needs

[00:53:54] to be asked just quickly uh wonder how you respond to his five factors

[00:53:58] leading to the destruction of this country inflation crooked politics divorce mysticism

[00:54:02] and if it feels good well um

[00:54:05] well I'm let's see uh we don't have a big inflation problem

[00:54:09] um the the cultural problems are serious the

[00:54:13] but it's it's unclear to what extent uh you can solve any

[00:54:16] of those problems directly there's nothing the government can do to solve the problem of divorce

[00:54:20] or if you feels if it feels good do it or anything like that

[00:54:24] you know I I think to a certain extent that that is true but I do think that you know

[00:54:28] the president and the government has a responsibility to try to help uh cut a break

[00:54:32] for families who are trying to you know work hard and play by the rules as it were and

[00:54:36] um okay things like the V chip for television you know for family television

[00:54:40] sets and that sort of thing that the president has introduced I think is going to help uh

[00:54:43] families try to fight this cultural Onslaught thanks we've been talking with

[00:54:47] Ellen Moran of Emily's List this morning and Peter till of the independent

[00:54:51] Institute in the newspaper Roundtable we appreciate you both being here

[00:54:54] take care thank you thank you and we'll be right back

[00:54:59] [Music]
