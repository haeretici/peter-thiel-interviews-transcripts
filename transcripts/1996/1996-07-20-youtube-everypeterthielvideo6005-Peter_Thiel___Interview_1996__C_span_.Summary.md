### Topic Summaries

#### TWA Flight 800 Bombing and Islamic Terrorism
Peter Thiel discusses a Baltimore Sun article suggesting the TWA Flight 800 crash was likely a bombing, with preliminary evidence linking it to Ramzi Yousef, the suspected mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center attack. He emphasizes the long-term threat of Islamic terrorism in the U.S., calling for proactive prevention measures beyond immediate sadness. Ellen Moran briefly defers to the evidence-gathering process.

#### Airport Security and Luggage Scanning
Ellen Moran highlights a Washington Post article on the lack of routine X-ray scanning for checked luggage, noting post-Gulf War tightenings but ongoing vulnerabilities. She points out the high cost of advanced scanners (about $1 million each) as a barrier, predicting debates on implementation amid airline solvency pressures. Tests are underway in San Francisco and Atlanta. Thiel agrees costs are prohibitive but implies safety must prevail.

#### EMILY's List and Guest Introductions
The host introduces Ellen Moran as training director at EMILY's List, where she oversees a campaign training program for Democratic pro-choice women candidates' staff (managers, press secretaries, fundraisers) via intensive 3-6 day sessions with experts. She also recruits and assesses candidates for House, Senate, and gubernatorial races. Thiel is introduced as a research fellow at the Independent Institute and co-author of *The Diversity Myth*.

#### Sexual Harassment Case at the Naval Academy
Thiel references a Baltimore Sun article on Midshipman Scott Ward's assault charges, noting how initial accusations unraveled under scrutiny, revealing consensual relationships and mixed motivations. He views this as a positive shift toward skepticism of politically correct "crusades," arguing serious charges require corroboration to avoid ruining lives, unlike the Tailhook scandal. Moran stresses taking claims seriously, citing allegations of non-consensual demands after partying, while acknowledging Ward's right to a fair hearing. The discussion broadens to military gender tensions, Clinton Administration-military friction, and institutional divisions.

#### The Diversity Myth Book and Multi-Racial Census Categories
Thiel promotes his book *The Diversity Myth* (co-authored with David Sacks), arguing true diversity requires ideological variance, not just superficial differences, and critiques hypocrisy in "diversity communities." On a New York Times article about multi-racial Americans seeking a census category, he opposes endless racial subdivisions (e.g., Stanford's "half-Asian" group) and advocates eliminating all racial categories to end government-encouraged divisions. Moran supports adding a multi-racial option for self-identification, arguing it's essential for tracking societal impacts on groups, and dismisses abolishing categories as unlikely.

#### Caller Discussion on TWA Bombing Response
A Watertown, NY, caller (former Marine) analyzes the bombing's timing and location for maximum visibility, urging a swift, severe, unified global response based on explosives expertise. Moran agrees on the need for forcefulness once confirmed, while Thiel expresses skepticism, citing the unresolved 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing and limited U.S. actions against state sponsors like Libya and Iran.

#### Caller on Partial-Birth Abortion Ban and Political Trust
A Tucson caller criticizes a Weekly Standard-reported GOP memo from John Boehner as disingenuous, lamenting politicians' lack of principles (citing Roger Marris's book) and foreign oil dependence. Thiel advises trusting ideas over people, critiquing Clinton and Dole as poll-driven. Moran notes the procedure's rarity in dire cases.

#### Caller on Bob Dole's Education Record and School Vouchers
A San Antonio caller questions Dole's "education president" claim, citing votes against Head Start, school lunches, and drug-free zones. Moran highlights Dole's centrist shift despite opposing popular programs like Medicare. Thiel downplays Head Start's efficacy, praising vouchers as a competitive, bottom-up innovation versus top-down federal mandates.

#### Caller on Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker's Resignation Drama
A Newark, AR, caller questions the lack of national media on Tucker's flip-flopping resignation amid impeachment threats. Thiel attributes it to Clinton-linked media bias and portrays Arkansas as a "Banana Republic" with elite control. Moran confirms national coverage, blames poor form on Tucker, and downplays Clinton ties.

#### Organizational Websites and Hyperlinks
The host promotes hyperlinks from C-SPAN's homepage to the Independent Institute (independent.com) and EMILY's List (emilyslist.org), encouraging viewers to explore.

#### Caller on GOP Internal Divisions and Dole's Candidacy
A Daytona Beach caller shares an op-ed and talk radio speculation about GOP leaders pressuring Dole to withdraw. Moran cites platform fights and convention choices (e.g., Colin Powell, Susan Molinari) as evidence of disunity. Thiel agrees on divisions but notes they're common in large parties, blaming Dole's lack of principled message for amplifying them.

#### Caller on Woman Jailed for Yelling at President Clinton
An Austin caller questions the arrest of Patricia Mendoza for yelling "You suck" (and possibly "you ought to die") at Clinton during a Chicago event, seeing it as free speech suppression. A Washington Post article details Secret Service intervention amid escalating profanity. Thiel notes presidential dignity's decline and threat ambiguity. Moran clarifies it's disorderly conduct, not pure speech, and trusts the Secret Service; both affirm broad free speech support absent threats.

#### Caller on Alleged Suppression of Conservative Voices at College Event
A Tampa caller (in her 60s) recounts a conservative graduate student's questions being revoked after approval, expressing concern over eroding freedoms under Clinton. Moran reiterates free speech's primacy without specifics on the incident.

#### Fact Check on Paula Jones Allegations and Senator D'Amato's Role
A fax questions Thiel's skepticism of Naval Academy claims versus Republican eagerness on Paula Jones's allegations against Clinton, urging D'Amato's recusal from hearings due to Dole ties. Thiel expresses doubt on Jones's coercion but notes the focus is Clinton's fidelity; he flips the double standard on harassment crusaders ignoring Jones.

#### Caller on Reparations for Japanese Diplomats' Children from WWII Internment
A Miami WWII veteran objects to a Miami Herald article on $20,000-220,000 payments to children of repatriated Japanese diplomats (dual citizens), calling it an outrage versus true victims. Thiel agrees, decrying "victim" status for extortion. Moran acknowledges internment's wrongness for U.S. citizens but questions cash for dual citizens.

#### Caller on Societal Rudeness, Beirut Bombing, and Free Speech Under Nixon
A St. Louis caller attributes rudeness to societal decay (not the presidency), notes muted Beirut response under Reagan, and defends free speech's vitality, citing Nixon's controlled audiences. Thiel likens campaigns to Shakespeare's "tale told by an idiot," urging skepticism of government's problem-solving limits. Moran credits Clinton's family-strengthening efforts (e.g., V-chip).

#### Broader Reflections on the Presidential Campaign and Government Limits
Thiel warns against over-focusing on campaigns or blaming Clinton for all ills, emphasizing government's inability to fix cultural issues like divorce. Moran highlights Clinton's family policies as helpful counter to "cultural onslaughts."

#### Caller on Biracial Census Category and African-American Political Power
An East Orange, NJ, African-American caller fears a New York Times-reported multi-racial category dilutes Black political strength in a racist society. Moran supports self-identification choices. Thiel agrees on personal rights but opposes government-defined groups, reiterating elimination of all categories.

#### Fact Check on Holocaust Museum Funding and Location
A fax criticizes the U.S. Holocaust Museum's $27 million federal funding and D.C. location (on donated public land) as misplaced versus Germany. The host notes an upcoming tour for further discussion.

#### Caller on Media Bias in Covering Democratic vs. Republican Wrongdoings
A Pascagoula, MS, caller suspects liberal media soft-pedals Democratic scandals (e.g., Watergate parallels). Thiel notes journalists' left-lean but credits competition for coverage. Moran argues media pursues scandals evenly as "stories," treating both parties fairly.

#### Bosnia Peace Process and War Crimes Trials
Thiel, on a top Bosnian Serb's resignation, laments "peace without justice," citing repeated genocides (e.g., China, Cambodia, Rwanda, Sudan) despite Holocaust vows. Moran supports Holbrooke's brokering, ongoing trials, and earlier U.S. involvement for atrocity prevention.

#### Caller on Expanding Reparations to Native Americans and Blacks
A Miami caller questions Japanese payments, asking why not compensate Native Americans or Blacks for slavery. Thiel agrees on stronger cases for them but warns of endless reparations (e.g., for poor education or parental neglect), insisting no political fixes for historical ills. Moran declines comment.

#### Caller on Media Underreporting of Filegate, Medicare Increases, and Societal Decline
A Wilmington, VT, senior decries media misrepresentation of "cuts" as increases (e.g., Medicare), obsesses over Filegate (700+ files vs. Watergate's one), and lists civilizational threats: inflation, crooked politics, divorce, mysticism, hedonism. Moran notes heavy Filegate coverage. Thiel links Filegate incompetence to broader doubts on government healthcare management; both downplay solvable cultural issues via policy.
