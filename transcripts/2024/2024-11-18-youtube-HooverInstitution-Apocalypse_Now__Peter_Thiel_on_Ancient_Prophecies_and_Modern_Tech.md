[Apocalypse Now? Peter Thiel on Ancient Prophecies and Modern Tech](https://youtu.be/qqHueZNEzig)

[00:00:00] >> Peter Robinson: Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge. The end times. Armageddon. the Antichrist.

[00:00:05] If you suppose the only people who take those concepts seriously

[00:00:10] are snake handlers in the hollers of Kentucky, think again.

[00:00:14] Peter Thiel on Uncommon Knowledge now.

[00:00:18] [MUSIC]

[00:00:28] >> Peter Robinson: Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge, I'm Peter Robinson. Peter Thiel earned his undergraduate and law degrees here at Stanford.

[00:00:35] He was a co-founder of PayPal, the firm that all but invented FinTech, the first

[00:00:40] outside investor in Facebook, the firm that all but invented social networks.

[00:00:45] And a co-founder of Palantir, the firm that all but invented defense tech.

[00:00:51] Although he's staying out of politics this year, Mr. Thiel has had a hand in

[00:00:55] launching the careers of a number of political figures, including JD Vance.

[00:00:59] Mr. Thiel speaks often on philosophy, religion, tech, and

[00:01:04] society in forums as diverse as the Cambridge Union,

[00:01:08] the Aspen Ideas Festival and the Joe Rogan Experience.

[00:01:11] You gave Joe Rogan three hours. Peter, it's about time you came back to this triathlon.

[00:01:16] >> Peter Thiel: I was trapped for three hours there. >> Peter Robinson: [LAUGH] Peter Thiel on the end times.

[00:01:22] Today, by the way, this is going to be episode one of two,

[00:01:26] our first conversation on this very large topic. Peter two quotations, Matthew 24:35 - 36, quote,

[00:01:34] heaven and earth will pass away, but of that day and hour,

[00:01:38] no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, close quote.

[00:01:43] Peter Thiel, we don't know the day and the hour,

[00:01:47] but maybe we can guess the century, explain yourself.

[00:01:52] >> Peter Thiel: Well, man, this is a very broad topic.

[00:01:58] It's in this larger question about

[00:02:02] the extraordinary history of our time.

[00:02:07] The modern world from maybe Renaissance onward has been this world

[00:02:12] of ever progressing scientific and technological development.

[00:02:17] And there is this very profound sense that there are things that change.

[00:02:24] There are dimensions of technology, military technology,

[00:02:28] communications technology, where things are not timeless and eternal.

[00:02:33] And there was a gunpowder revolution in the 17th century and

[00:02:38] that changed the social structure and the political structure.

[00:02:42] And there is a certain arc to history. It's not just technology, but it is a driver.

[00:02:49] And certainly, many different ways of getting at this, but

[00:02:54] there certainly are dimensions of the technology that have become

[00:03:00] extremely powerful in the last century or two that have an apocalyptic dimension.

[00:03:07] And perhaps it's strange not to try to relate it to the biblical tradition.

[00:03:12] If nuclear weapons can rain down fire and brimstone and

[00:03:16] destroy the world, and then we have a biblical tradition that maybe

[00:03:21] doesn't say that this is inevitably going to happen.

[00:03:25] But that something like this might well happen if humans are left

[00:03:29] to their own devices. Should we at least be asking questions, figure out ways for

[00:03:34] these things to inform one another? >> Peter Robinson: So obviously, we'll come in a moment to the analyses, to the signs of the end times.

[00:03:42] But first a moment on why you're asking these questions.

[00:03:46] And as I understand your argument, Peter, you feel you need

[00:03:51] to ask them and to prompt a conversation, at least in part,

[00:03:56] because universities won't, which is odd in some ways.

[00:04:01] The biblical framework, these texts may be 2000 years old,

[00:04:05] but they've informed Western civilization and taken up the time of scholarship.

[00:04:09] Through these centuries, it has been an understanding in

[00:04:14] Western culture at least, that history is going someplace.

[00:04:20] And if there is an end point, no matter how far off in the future it may be,

[00:04:24] we're closer to it now than we were. All right, so all of these seem to me plausible,

[00:04:30] valid, and serious questions. Why are universities ill equipped to grapple with this?

[00:04:37] >> Peter Thiel: Well, that's very overdetermined, but certainly anything

[00:04:41] that there's some relationship between the university and the universe.

[00:04:46] Where it is supposed to somehow, in its ideal form,

[00:04:50] in its early modern, 17th, 18th century form,

[00:04:54] the university was supposed to represent some kind of integration

[00:05:00] of knowledge across a lot of disciplines where they all would fit together.

[00:05:05] And for a variety of reasons one can cite, this has broken down over time.

[00:05:11] There are ideological reasons, but maybe there also are practical reasons where

[00:05:16] the amount of knowledge became too great for any single person to master.

[00:05:20] And then you had ever division into ever narrower sub disciplines.

[00:05:25] Adam Smith has this metaphor in the 19th century of a pin factory, where you're manufacturing pins and there are 100 people in the pin factory and

[00:05:32] they're all doing different things and nobody knows how to make a pin anymore.

[00:05:36] So it's efficient, but it's this hyper specialization.

[00:05:41] And there's probably been an analog to that on the university side, where

[00:05:46] maybe someone like Goethe could still understand something about everything.

[00:05:51] Or Hilbert, a great mathematician around 1900, could still understand all of math.

[00:05:57] And he'd set these 25 problems for the 20th century for

[00:06:00] mathematicians to solve, in some ways set the agenda for the field of mathematics.

[00:06:06] And even as rigorous a subject area as mathematics in some ways has devolved into

[00:06:11] something close to literary theory, where one mathematician doesn't know what the other one's doing.

[00:06:17] And it's sort of these very incommensurate modes of discourse, and

[00:06:23] anything that has to do with making sense of the larger whole has gotten badly lost.

[00:06:30] And I've thought for a long time that we need to ask a variety of questions about the larger whole.

[00:06:37] One kind of a scientific and technological question is simply,

[00:06:41] are we still progressing as we were in early modernity? Are things by whatever metric you choose?

[00:06:46] Are they getting better? Is life expectancy going up? Is the GDP increasing the quality of life by various metrics going up?

[00:06:54] Are we going faster, moving from planes to supersonic planes to space planes?

[00:07:01] And that seems like a very basic kind of macroeconomic question,

[00:07:08] incredibly hard to ask, but surely an important one.

[00:07:13] And I've spoken about this in many other contexts, but

[00:07:18] my intuition is that in many places, there's been relative stagnation.

[00:07:24] The hyperspecialization disguises a certain type of decadence where you have

[00:07:28] these narrow experts saying how wonderful they are, the cancer cell people sell,

[00:07:33] cancer researchers say they're gonna cure cancer in the next five years.

[00:07:37] And the string people say they're the smartest physicists and they know everything.

[00:07:41] But maybe it's just some weird academic power game

[00:07:46] where they're blocking everybody else and on and on.

[00:07:52] Even before we get to the big question of history, there's a question just of

[00:07:56] the history of science and technology, it progressed a lot.

[00:08:00] Maybe it's progressing more slowly. Why has that changed? What's going on there?

[00:08:04] >> Peter Robinson: You said so. Fragmentation, hyper specialization in the university,

[00:08:10] the feeling of kind of disintegration into silos. That's one aspect of it, another aspect of it, I'm checking this,

[00:08:18] this is the form of a question, is whether an extreme rationalism

[00:08:23] maybe emerges from that specialization or maybe informs it.

[00:08:28] But I've heard you say, I've got a quotation here from you.

[00:08:31] Under the rationalist view, you can't even talk about the end of your own life,

[00:08:36] let alone the end of the world. That there's something about the regnant view,

[00:08:42] I'm trying to resist the word ideology because ideology isn't quite the right.

[00:08:47] But the way the university conducts its business rules out questions of life,

[00:08:55] death, sin, redemption, the meaning of history.

[00:08:59] So what I'm trying to get at is hyper specialization,

[00:09:04] yes, is there also something else, something about the regnant view that makes it very hard for

[00:09:13] universities to grapple with big questions.

[00:09:17] >> Peter Thiel: Yes, they seem hard to grapple with it,

[00:09:22] why is probably harder to say. Certainly if we do something like the radical life extension project.

[00:09:31] People in the 17th, 18th centuries were very optimistic about it.

[00:09:35] Benjamin Franklin, Francis Bacon,

[00:09:39] you had all these ideas that you could extend human lifespan by centuries.

[00:09:48] As late as the late 19th, early 20th century, there was a movement called

[00:09:52] cosmism in the sort of around the time of the Soviet Revolution, 1920s Soviet Union.

[00:09:58] And it claimed that for the revolution to succeed, you had to physically resurrect all the dead people using science and

[00:10:06] workers of the world unite and to sort of get with the times.

[00:10:10] Their slogan was Dead of the world, unite and then of course, they didn't make much progress on this.

[00:10:15] And then at some point, by the time you get to Stalin and the show trials and the deaths seem to be going up, not down, but.

[00:10:21] >> Peter Robinson: There was a moment when they thought it might even be possible.

[00:10:24] >> Peter Thiel: There was an incredible ambition, an incredible energy to modern science.

[00:10:30] It was perhaps downstream from Christianity, if the promise of

[00:10:34] Christianity is a physical resurrection, then science could offer that too.

[00:10:41] It was a possibility, maybe it was a rival to Christianity.

[00:10:45] You don't need Christianity if we can do it through science.

[00:10:49] And then there is a strange way that the project in many dimensions

[00:10:54] feels very exhausted. Even though of course, people still genuflect science, they believe in

[00:11:01] science with a capital S, but the ambition has been really beaten out.

[00:11:05] If you look at the individual scientists,

[00:11:10] it's much less of this sort of heroic, bold figure,

[00:11:15] breaks with dogmas and thinks for him or herself.

[00:11:19] And it's much more in late modernity, you're just a robot in a ever smaller cog,

[00:11:26] in an ever bigger machine or something like this.

[00:11:30] >> Peter Robinson: All right, this notion of the end of times in

[00:11:34] the biblical framework, Rene Girard,

[00:11:38] Rene Girard is an important figure here.

[00:11:43] Professor of French literature here at Stanford, but also a theologian,

[00:11:48] I think it's fair to call him a theologian and philosopher.

[00:11:52] Wrote very, very widely, although that was outside his Stanford work.

[00:11:57] You became friends with him, it happens that he was a neighbor of mine,

[00:12:01] we both knew Rene. All right, Rene Girard in 2009.

[00:12:05] Few still talk about the apocalypse, the apocalypse, of course, is the word referring to the destruction or

[00:12:11] end of the world as described in the book of Revelation. Rene, few still talk about the apocalypse, and

[00:12:17] they usually have a completely mythological conception of it.

[00:12:20] Strangely, they do not see that the violence we ourselves are in

[00:12:25] the process of amassing and that is looming over our

[00:12:29] own heads is entirely sufficient to trigger the worst, close quote.

[00:12:34] So there we come to the first question about how you understand these things. The apocalypse as presented in the biblical

[00:12:41] framework as symbols of spiritual realities, or

[00:12:46] the apocalypse as a plain prediction about how the world could, or indeed will end.

[00:12:54] >> Peter Thiel: Yeah, let's see, it is the way Girard would have put it, and

[00:12:59] the way I came to see it as well, was that in some sense, the apocalyptic

[00:13:05] prophecies are just a prediction of what humans are likely to do.

[00:13:10] In a world in which they have ever more powerful technologies,

[00:13:15] in which there are no sacred limits on the use of these technologies,

[00:13:20] in which human nature has maybe not gotten worse, but has not gotten better.

[00:13:28] And it has this sort of limitless

[00:13:34] violence aspect to it.

[00:13:38] I think Gerard had all these provocative formulations,

[00:13:42] like, it is just a scientific prediction of what humanity is

[00:13:47] likely to do in a world of ever more powerful technology.

[00:13:53] And then there sort of are all these different things one can say in

[00:13:56] terms of the biblical apocalyptic accounts. But Girard was very skeptical of the idea that somehow the violence came from God.

[00:14:06] And he always thought that atheists and fundamentalists disagree on the secondary

[00:14:11] and relatively not so important question of whether or not God exists.

[00:14:16] But they agree on the far more important question that one of God's attributes

[00:14:22] is violence, and so the violence comes from God and this is the new atheist.

[00:14:28] >> Peter Robinson: In the evangelical view, the destruction of the world is God exercising justice on the world.

[00:14:34] >> Peter Thiel: It is, yeah. >> Peter Robinson: Right. >> Peter Thiel: It's some version of justice.

[00:14:39] >> Peter Robinson: Anger wrath. >> Peter Thiel: Some version of the anger wrath of God and

[00:14:45] then the atheist one's a little bit stranger because

[00:14:50] you don't really believe God exists but still it's not humanity.

[00:14:57] Humanity is not that dangerous at least in sort of

[00:15:02] the mainstream lock in Rousseauian accounts.

[00:15:07] >> Peter Robinson: So you've made the point I must admit I'd forgotten this.

[00:15:13] You've made the point that Rene used to observe that the church

[00:15:18] the Catholic Church in its liturgy and in homilies used to make quite a lot

[00:15:23] of the end times and warn people to prepare for judgment and so forth.

[00:15:28] Up until 1945 when the church seems to have decided to go easier on

[00:15:34] that because people needed comfort more than exhortation about the end times.

[00:15:40] Obvious point what happened in 1945 >> Peter Thiel: well we got nuclear

[00:15:44] weapons and the stuff became real in a way that seemed completely

[00:15:49] implausible in the 17th, 18th century I mean when people were

[00:15:55] writing about these things in the 18th even 19th century it was.

[00:16:00] The idea that the world was just too big a place, it could not possibly be destroyed,

[00:16:05] we didn't believe God would do it. We no longer believed that God was so

[00:16:09] violent that God would do it even if you believed he existed.

[00:16:13] And then the technology was getting more powerful, but

[00:16:18] it didn't quite seem possible to do something on a worldwide scale.

[00:16:24] The Napoleonic wars are quite violent.

[00:16:27] World War I is significantly worse, but

[00:16:31] it's still somehow localized, it's not the whole planet.

[00:16:37] And then there is something that gets released with nuclear weapons and

[00:16:41] maybe even more with thermonuclear weapons. And then you end up building not dozens but thousands and

[00:16:47] thousands of them in the 60s and 70s. >> Peter Robinson: Rene's point that the apocalyptic literature correctly read is

[00:16:54] simply a prediction of what human beings will do to each other suddenly becomes.

[00:16:59] Up until 1945, he says, wait a minute, how could human beings possibly be responsible for the end of the world?

[00:17:05] And after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the answer is only too obvious.

[00:17:10] >> Peter Thiel: There's liberal theologian writing in 1780.

[00:17:14] The argument for why you should read apocalyptic literature is because

[00:17:18] occasionally you get these millenarian movements and people go crazy.

[00:17:22] And it's worth reminding yourselves of the madness of crowds.

[00:17:26] And then the secondary reason you can read it is for your amusement.

[00:17:31] And that was sort of the Enlightenment optimism circa 1780.

[00:17:36] And there were all these incredibly scary ideas.

[00:17:41] The Antichrist would kill so many people, he would come with a crematorium to burn the bodies of all the people he killed.

[00:17:48] The sort of lurid medieval notions people had. And of course then after the end of Hitler in 1945,

[00:17:55] this stuff just wasn't so funny anymore. And then Girard's intuition was that it's almost

[00:18:03] like when a knowledge becomes too real and too close.

[00:18:09] I don't like psychological repression or something like this, but

[00:18:12] you wanna sort of steer away from it. >> Peter Robinson: We can't bear to look at it. >> Peter Thiel: We don't want to talk about it quite as much.

[00:18:17] We need to reassure people. We need to tell people this is not really what it's about.

[00:18:22] And of course, there were all these strange elements of the mythical that were brought in.

[00:18:27] It was named after all these terrible gods from ancient Greece.

[00:18:33] Saturn, the God who ate his own children. And Zeus throws down thunderbolts, and

[00:18:38] we have fire raining down with Jupiter rockets from the heavens.

[00:18:42] So there was this strange return of the mythical in this

[00:18:47] very in the equations of the physicists.

[00:18:51] >> Peter Robinson: Development since 1940 Again, Rene, the violence we ourselves are in the process of amassing.

[00:18:57] So development since 1945, two quotations here,

[00:19:02] Sir Martin Rees in his 2003 book Our Final Century, there's a cheerful title for you.

[00:19:09] The nuclear threat will be overshadowed by others that could be as destructive and

[00:19:13] far less controllable. Advanced technology will offer new instruments for creating terror and

[00:19:19] devastation. Instant universal communications will amplify their societal impact,

[00:19:25] this is over 20 years ago. Disastrous accidents, for instance, the unintended creation or

[00:19:31] release of a noxious, fast spreading pathogen are possible.

[00:19:34] I think the odds are no better than fifty-fifty that we will

[00:19:39] survive to the end of the present century. Quotation two Revelation 16:16 and the demonic spirits

[00:19:47] assembled the kings at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.

[00:19:53] I want to get the word Armageddon in here because you use it,

[00:19:59] it's important in your analysis.

[00:20:02] Okay, so the notion is the idea of some

[00:20:07] kind of final cataclysmic event.

[00:20:11] Revelation tells us that in a book written some 2,000 years ago,

[00:20:16] Martin Rees book is written 21 years ago. And it's all entirely plausible.

[00:20:22] >> Peter Thiel: Sure, and I think there is a way we can come back to this in

[00:20:27] describing all of this in a much more rationalist, non theological way.

[00:20:34] So you can talk about existential risk and there is existential risk of nuclear war.

[00:20:41] There's existential risk of bioweapons or

[00:20:45] dangerously engineered bioweapons, maybe of AI and

[00:20:50] killer robots or autonomous weapon systems guided by AI.

[00:20:56] There is existential risk around the environment, maybe not just climate change, but maybe there's all sorts of other dimensions

[00:21:05] where there's some argument we have one planet and you wanna be a little bit careful and not mess it up totally.

[00:21:11] >> Peter Robinson: Peter on AI I've never had a chance to just put this one to you.

[00:21:16] I don't know as much about it as you obviously, but I've been aware of a technology that was so polarizing from the get go.

[00:21:24] There are plenty of people who say, calm down, AI is gonna lead to one medical breakthrough after another.

[00:21:29] It'll produce such abundance that we don't need to worry about jobs. We'll be able to provide for our, that's one.

[00:21:36] And then of course there's this other strain that we'll have military.

[00:21:41] Well, here, Henry Kissinger, I found this quotation from a book, Kissinger's last book, which he wrote with Eric Schmidt, quote, if you imagine a war

[00:21:49] between China and the United States, you have artificial intelligence weapons.

[00:21:53] Nobody has really tested these things on a broad scale, and you can't tell

[00:21:57] exactly what will happen when AI fighter planes on both sides interact.

[00:22:01] So you are then in a world of potentially total destructiveness, close quote.

[00:22:08] And your view, how are we to understand AI?

[00:22:12] >> Peter Thiel: Well, partially it's unknown, it can mean a lot of different things.

[00:22:18] It's poorly defined, AI can mean the next generation of computers,

[00:22:22] the last generation of computers, anything in between. I think the classic definition of AI was something that passed the Turing test and

[00:22:31] that could fool you into thinking it was a human being in some sense that had

[00:22:36] not been passed, but was passed by ChatGPT in late 22, early 23.

[00:22:42] And so that is a pretty significant development.

[00:22:45] >> Peter Robinson: And does it feel like an inflection point as important as 1945?

[00:22:50] >> Peter Thiel: I think it's on par, let's say, in the computer world,

[00:22:54] I think it's on par with the Internet in the late 90s.

[00:22:58] And then there are so many different ways it can

[00:23:03] be applied that are good and that are dangerous that

[00:23:09] it's hard to know how to quite wait them all out.

[00:23:14] If I had to score the Silicon Valley debate, I'm not on the Luddite side.

[00:23:19] I always try to be more on the protect side.

[00:23:23] But if I had to score it as a debate, I do believe the effective altruists are winning the argument.

[00:23:29] And the argument is something like, there are a lot of dangerous corner cases with this technology and

[00:23:36] we should be really careful, we don't quite know how it's gonna work.

[00:23:41] Maybe it doesn't become a godlike intelligence, which is some of the sort of futuristic transhumanist nonsense.

[00:23:48] But it could just be this autonomous weapon system on a drone where we

[00:23:53] want to make them autonomous, because if you have a human in the loop,

[00:23:58] the human gets jammed. So. There's a logic to a lot of these things.

[00:24:04] And then there are aspects that become more first strike type weapons.

[00:24:08] And there's some kind of crazy arms race between the US and communist China.

[00:24:13] Then how does this affect that arms race and change it?

[00:24:17] So there are sort of a lot of questions like that.

[00:24:22] I would say the larger existential risk point that I always made is that

[00:24:28] there's a way in which the people who are worried about these existential risks.

[00:24:35] And you can also criticize them. You can criticize them for being Luddites and etc.

[00:24:40] But you can also criticize them for not being apocalyptic enough.

[00:24:44] Because most of the time, they're just focused on one. It's like the nuclear weapons people are still just talking about nukes.

[00:24:52] And Greta, she's, it's just the climate.

[00:24:56] She's not worried about AI and she's not worried about nukes, and much less

[00:25:01] the COVID virus that was bioengineered in the Wuhan lab or something like this.

[00:25:08] And then I've often thought you should get all these people who are worried

[00:25:13] about existential risk in a room, and they have to fight it out and

[00:25:18] decide which ones really matter and how to prioritize them.

[00:25:22] And in some sense, the scary answer is there's some truth to all of them.

[00:25:26] And then if we were to do that exercise fully, what I would wanna do is I would

[00:25:32] also like to throw in one more existential risk that, in my mind,

[00:25:37] is as big as all these technological risks of the nuclear war and

[00:25:42] runaway bioweapons and weaponized AI with autonomous weapon systems.

[00:25:47] And that's the risk of a totalitarian one-world government.

[00:25:54] And again, with all the other existential risks, it's hard to know how to

[00:25:59] measure these things probabilistically because we only have one world.

[00:26:04] Once you get a totalitarian one-world government, you can't reverse it.

[00:26:11] And then the reason I like to throw that risk in

[00:26:15] is that it seems to me that the implicit solution

[00:26:21] to existential risks of all the other sorts is

[00:26:25] to lean in to a sort of very non-democratic,

[00:26:30] one-world state that will highly regulate and

[00:26:36] stop these technologies. And if Greta gets everyone on the planet to ride a bicycle,

[00:26:43] maybe that's a way to solve climate change, but it has sort of this quality of going from the frying pan into the fire.

[00:26:51] >> Peter Robinson: Right, again, if I understand your argument,

[00:26:56] this is already clear in the way we lead our lives in this slowing of progress.

[00:27:04] Now, this, it seems to me, is worth dwelling on because it shows that the fear is real and

[00:27:11] has genuine effects in the way we all lead our lives.

[00:27:16] But we have to spend a moment or two defining it. So if I may, let me start with a quotation from you.

[00:27:22] There has been a narrow cone of progress around computers, the Internet,

[00:27:27] and maybe now artificial intelligence. But if tech means producing more with less,

[00:27:32] then we should be seeing dramatic economic progress, we don't.

[00:27:37] The millennials are not dramatically better off than their boomer parents,

[00:27:42] close quote. Okay, so you mentioned it a moment ago, but

[00:27:48] return to this notion of slowing technical progress.

[00:27:53] This great disappointment, by contrast, what we see around us today,

[00:27:57] what we feel around us today, by contrast with a century or so ago. >> Peter Thiel: Or even late 60s.

[00:28:03] >> Peter Robinson: Yes, yes, okay. >> Peter Thiel: Jensen's Star Trek, the sort of optimistic science fiction of

[00:28:09] the 50s and 60s where, yeah, we'd have flying cars,

[00:28:13] you'd have supersonic aviation everywhere, all sorts of cures for diseases.

[00:28:19] And yes, there was an incredible amount of progress in this world of bits,

[00:28:23] much less in the world of atoms. I always think a lot of what we do is embedded in this physical world of atoms.

[00:28:30] And so when that slows, that's definitely felt as quite stagnant.

[00:28:37] The question I always then get at, and then you get into endless debates,

[00:28:41] is this true, or is there still a lot of progress? How would one measure it?

[00:28:45] I tend to measure it in things like these economic terms in the way that the average millennial is having a tougher time than their boomer

[00:28:52] parents at the same point in life. And so at least there's something, even if we're not completely stuck,

[00:29:00] it's in some sense not really moving as fast as it used to.

[00:29:04] And then there's always a question of why this is. >> Peter Robinson: Right. >> Peter Thiel: And

[00:29:08] why questions are overdetermined.

[00:29:13] And as a libertarian, I always like to say it's too regulated and the FDA regulates the drugs too much.

[00:29:18] And if you regulated drugs, if you regulated video games like

[00:29:22] the FDA regulates drugs, we'd still all just be playing Pong.

[00:29:26] And so there's a libertarian anti-regulatory thing.

[00:29:31] There is a argument that the schools aren't teaching people and they're not teaching people to be scientists.

[00:29:37] Some of the educational institutions are broken. There's sort of an anti-liberal argument. >> Peter Robinson: Some truth in all of this.

[00:29:43] >> Peter Thiel: There is a Tyler Cowen argument that somehow, the low-hanging fruit was picked.

[00:29:49] There was a bunch of easy discoveries to make. And now, nature's cupboard is kind of bare, and

[00:29:54] you have to reach really hard to make a modest discovery.

[00:29:58] And maybe that's true. Maybe that's just sort of a self-serving excuse of baby boomers who didn't do

[00:30:04] as much as the generations that came before, but it is very striking.

[00:30:09] One way to quantify this, even if we say the rate of progress in broad

[00:30:14] fields is the same as it was 100 years ago, not that it's slowed.

[00:30:19] But even if we say it's the same, if you think of PhDs,

[00:30:23] there are probably 100 times as many PhDs today as there were in, say, 1924.

[00:30:28] And so it's the same rate of progress. And the average PhD is 99% less productive than people were 100 years ago.

[00:30:37] And that doesn't seem like a very healthy scientific ecosystem.

[00:30:42] So there's some sense that maybe it slowed.

[00:30:46] But the overarching explanation that I've come to think is a very

[00:30:51] important one is just this idea that, in some way, science and

[00:30:56] technology were this trap that humanity was building for itself.

[00:31:01] That there were these apocalyptic risks and

[00:31:07] maybe going very slow was better

[00:31:12] than racing towards Armageddon.

[00:31:16] And so, yeah, I was born in 1967.

[00:31:21] I always often express frustration that I'm stuck

[00:31:26] in these office buildings or houses that are decades old.

[00:31:32] There are all these parts of our society that feel lame,

[00:31:36] slow-changing, low energy, low testosterone, nothing is going on.

[00:31:42] And then I do wonder if we were in a Jetsons type world,

[00:31:46] we might not even be sitting here to talk about it.

[00:31:50] It might have self-destructed by that. >> Peter Robinson: Right. >> Peter Thiel: If you had a JFK as president on amphetamines going mano

[00:31:57] a mano with Khrushchev, it worked. In 1962, would it have worked every time?

[00:32:04] >> Peter Robinson: So, by the way, someplace, I didn't make a note of this,

[00:32:07] but someplace I saw you say that Facebook had ten years of good press.

[00:32:12] In other words, ten years of optimism, before the project sort of curdled in the public mind.

[00:32:18] And that AI went from good to bad in about a month, this loss of optimism.

[00:32:26] So I have a quotation here, there are many explanations for

[00:32:30] this deceleration in tech, this is you. But the explanation I believe, tech got scary.

[00:32:37] We're leery of it now, we're not embracing it in the way that we used to.

[00:32:41] Add to that the notion that, again, I'm thinking this through,

[00:32:47] but I'm putting it to you as a question.

[00:32:51] This isn't the way things were supposed to be when the Cold War ended, right?

[00:32:56] >> Peter Thiel: Sure. >> Peter Robinson: Russia was supposed to work, there was democracy and

[00:33:01] free markets. And instead, we have this crazy man, Putin invading Ukraine.

[00:33:05] By now there should have been at least some kind of

[00:33:09] rudimentary peace in the Mid East. Perhaps the most striking contradiction of what we expect was that by now,

[00:33:18] China was supposed to be democratic. It was supposed to follow the pattern of South Korea and Taiwan,

[00:33:25] where first you have economic growth, and economic growth creates expectations,

[00:33:31] including expectations of freedom, free speech, and so forth.

[00:33:35] And these countries become democratic. China was supposed to follow that path,

[00:33:39] things are not going the way they were supposed to. Add to that, our own sense of polarization in this country,

[00:33:47] that this country somehow, and there's just a lot of feeling of, it's subjective.

[00:33:54] It's very difficult to get at, but it feels to me as though there's a lot of free floating dread.

[00:34:01] >> Peter Thiel: And it's hard to articulate. I'll give one example, and you can think about this what you will.

[00:34:08] But a lot of my conservative friends are very critical of Fauci and

[00:34:12] all the lockdowns and the masks and the social distancing and the vaccine that didn't really work.

[00:34:19] And on the surface level, these critiques are, I think, quite legitimate.

[00:34:25] It was not the correct protocol for some kind of flu.

[00:34:31] It was, however, roughly, the right protocol if you thought it was a bioweapon.

[00:34:39] If you think it's a very dangerous, humanly engineered bioweapon,

[00:34:44] those are roughly all the kinds of things that you might do.

[00:34:49] And so, the kind of critique I have of Fauci is that,

[00:34:53] yeah, that's what he was scared of, I think.

[00:34:58] That's the way I'd steel man him, give him the benefit of the doubt. And then the real critique is that,

[00:35:03] you weren't supposed to infantilize our population and not talk about it.

[00:35:08] And that's what he was scared about, and he was so scared about it,

[00:35:11] he couldn't even talk about it. And there probably are a lot of things like this where, yeah, there is this

[00:35:18] pretty inchoate fear, but we're so scared we can't even talk about it cogently.

[00:35:24] >> Peter Robinson: There's one more concept we need to flesh out, a term that you use.

[00:35:29] We'll put all the pieces of this together, although that may happen in the second

[00:35:34] part of our conversation, and that is the katechon. The term comes from the Greek for he, or that which restrains.

[00:35:44] We'll come in a moment, to your analysis of the katechon through history, but

[00:35:48] first, again, the concept itself. St. Paul in his letter to the Thessalonians, chapter 2 verse 6 to 7,

[00:35:55] and now you know what is restraining, again, in Greek, katechon.

[00:36:00] And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time.

[00:36:05] For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, only he who restrains the Ketachon, he who now restrains will do so

[00:36:13] until he is taken out of the way, close quote. Now, that's a very enigmatic passage.

[00:36:19] The Church has never defined the term. The Church fathers, the early writers and thinkers in the Church,

[00:36:27] wrote about it, but tended to add that their views were speculative.

[00:36:32] So we don't have any thoroughly worked out theology of the catacomb,

[00:36:40] but we do have, 2,000 years ago in St.

[00:36:44] Paul, a notion of some force holding back chaos,

[00:36:50] holding back evil, some force that's restraining.

[00:36:56] We get to Cardinal Newman, writing in the 19th century, Cardinal Newman,

[00:37:01] the great thinker and theologian, in my judgment, the best prose stylist of the whole century, in English.

[00:37:07] Cardinal Newman writes, we know from prophecy that the present framework of

[00:37:11] society and government is that which withholdeth, again, the Katechon.

[00:37:15] So he identifies it with a framework of society and government.

[00:37:19] All right, that's my little effort to present the concept of the katechon.

[00:37:25] You use that concept how, you identify the katechon through history.

[00:37:31] >> Peter Thiel: Yeah, as you said, it's a rather mysterious concept,

[00:37:35] you can identify it with the good aspects of the Roman Empire,

[00:37:40] certain political aspects of the Roman Catholic Church, individuals.

[00:37:45] Institutions that somehow are trying

[00:37:50] to hold this runaway chaos in check.

[00:37:55] I don't think it's purely reactionary, you can think of Metternich

[00:38:00] post Napoleon as sort of katechomatic, but he's also modernizing it.

[00:38:05] It is a thing of history, though. And so, there are ways to do it that can be good for

[00:38:13] a time, but that will not necessarily work for all times.

[00:38:19] But I would always maybe go back to the apocalyptic specter,

[00:38:27] would be Antichrist or Armageddon.

[00:38:31] And I think there is a lot in this runaway science

[00:38:36] technology that's pushing us towards something like Armageddon.

[00:38:44] And then there is the natural pushback on this is,

[00:38:49] we will avoid Armageddon by having a one world

[00:38:54] state that has real teeth, real power.

[00:38:59] And the biblical term for that is the Antichrist.

[00:39:04] And the Christian intuition I have is,

[00:39:07] I don't want Antichrist, I don't want Armageddon.

[00:39:13] I would like to find some narrow path between these two where we can avoid both.

[00:39:21] And then certainly, there are ways that you defer it if you can,

[00:39:27] you try to do new things. I don't think it's a purely reactionary thing.

[00:39:32] It's not a pure Benedictine option where you just retreat into a monastery or

[00:39:38] something like that. I think that's the most accelerationist thing possible.

[00:39:46] >> Peter Robinson: You quit resisting. >> Peter Thiel: You quit, it sort of clears the field, it's like the Lord Acton

[00:39:50] line, all that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing.

[00:39:54] And so this is where I'm always, it can be the Benedictine option, it can be good for

[00:39:59] Personal sanctification, but to the extent we're [CROSSTALK] talking

[00:40:03] about society, our first- >> Peter Robinson: Rod Dreher wrote a book about this, the idea of going to the [INAUDIBLE] the idea is that Christians simply drop out.

[00:40:10] Society is going in the wrong direction, and Christians simply drop out, that's roughly the idea.

[00:40:15] >> Peter Thiel: I don't want to argue with him on the level of

[00:40:18] personal sanctification or people saving their souls.

[00:40:24] My political, social intuition is that it's the height

[00:40:28] of your responsibility because that is just, in effect,

[00:40:32] hitting the accelerator towards the Antichrist, Armageddon.

[00:40:36] >> Peter Robinson: Okay, let's finish this first part of our conversation with more

[00:40:41] on the Antichrist, let me take a moment to set this up, if I may.

[00:40:47] A few passages from Scripture, Daniel, chapter 7, in the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream.

[00:40:55] There before me was a beast, fearful, terrifying, very strong, it had great

[00:41:00] iron teeth, and it ate its victims and trampled their remains underfoot.

[00:41:06] Second Thessalonians, chapter 2, we're back to St. Paul, he's writing about the end times.

[00:41:11] It cannot happen until there has appeared the wicked one,

[00:41:14] the lost one, the enemy who raises himself above every object of worship and

[00:41:19] flaunts the claim that he is God. Revelation, chapter 13, then I saw a beast emerge from the sea, and

[00:41:26] they prostrated themselves in front of the beast, saying,

[00:41:30] who can compare with the beast, who can fight against it?

[00:41:34] And all the people of the world will worship it, close quote.

[00:41:40] There are people who take all of this seriously, we've already quoted Rene Girard.

[00:41:44] We've already quoted Cardinal Newman, but Daniel dates from the Iron Age.

[00:41:50] Thessalonians and Revelation are 2000 years old, contemporary society.

[00:41:55] We sit here in Stanford University, contemporary society all but

[00:42:02] ignores these texts or derides them.

[00:42:07] Of interest only to snake handlers, as I mentioned, stake handlers in Kentucky hollers, you are no snake handler.

[00:42:14] >> Peter Thiel: Well- >> Peter Robinson: You take this stuff. >> Peter Thiel: Not that I'm aware of,no. >> Peter Robinson: Not that you're aware of [LAUGH] not that I'm aware of, so

[00:42:20] we'll come to how the Antichrist might arise. What we must do to prevent, we'll come to that in our second conversation.

[00:42:26] But the first thing I want to establish is why do you take this seriously?

[00:42:31] >> Peter Thiel: Well, again, one can take it seriously without taking it completely literally.

[00:42:37] But just let me maybe defend Daniel, the Old Testament prophet.

[00:42:43] And if you contrast it with, let's say, a Greco-Roman understanding of history.

[00:42:48] Thucydides, Herodotus, Thucydides writes the account of

[00:42:53] the Peloponnesian wars between Athens and Sparta.

[00:42:57] And it has a timeless and eternal character, it's the rising power against the existing power, Athens is the rising power.

[00:43:06] And the Thucydides trap is when this repeats itself with Wilhelmine Germany

[00:43:10] against Britain in 1914, or perhaps today, China against the US.

[00:43:15] It's timeless, internal, the particulars don't matter, the speeches people give don't matter, Thucydides makes them up.

[00:43:22] And it's sort of like a natural, cyclical kind of a view

[00:43:27] of history or one where there is no specific history.

[00:43:32] And then, by contrast, I do not think it's an exaggeration

[00:43:37] to say something like, Daniel was the first historian where

[00:43:41] the things that matter are one time and world historical.

[00:43:46] And there was a creation, there was a fall, there's a Mosaic revelation- >> Peter Robinson: History going

[00:43:53] someplace. >> Peter Thiel: It's going somewhere, and the choices people make matter,

[00:43:59] and some of the choices matter in a very big way.

[00:44:03] And there's a way that Christ's ministry and death and

[00:44:07] resurrection was a part of history or a hinge moment of history.

[00:44:12] And then there are ways it continues, and I think that's sort of a feel for history.

[00:44:20] And something like Hegel is just a pale shadow

[00:44:25] of the Judeo-Christian sense of history.

[00:44:30] Again, you have to qualify this very carefully,

[00:44:34] but you could say that the New Testament God is the first progressive because the new supersedes the old.

[00:44:42] And so it's the first time that there is something new just by virtue of it being new.

[00:44:47] There's something new that comes in through history, all these ways you have to qualify.

[00:44:53] If you go too progressive, you get to something like Marcion or Marx, but

[00:44:58] if you say it's all in the Old Testament, that's somehow not quite right either.

[00:45:04] >> Peter Robinson: So you take it seriously because you don't believe

[00:45:09] history is Groundhog Day. It doesn't happen over and over again, this cyclical aspect,

[00:45:16] the eternal recurrence. Then in some fundamental way, the meaninglessness of it, history is going

[00:45:22] someplace, and if it's going someplace, that means there will be an end point.

[00:45:27] >> Peter Thiel: And there are important things that will happen that are different from things that happened in the past.

[00:45:34] And so if we want to have a feel for our times,

[00:45:40] what is going on in the world in the early 21st century,

[00:45:46] there are ways we can try to reference it to the past.

[00:45:52] You can say there's some parallel between the decline of the United States and

[00:45:57] the fall of the Roman Empire, but the differences are surely really important.

[00:46:02] It's happening in a world of nuclear weapons and instantaneous communication, and it's happening in a very post Christian or

[00:46:11] hyper Christian world, not in a pagan world.

[00:46:15] And somehow the classical approaches to history always

[00:46:20] downplay the things that are one time unique, world historical,

[00:46:27] and I think we should take our bearings more from that.

[00:46:32] >> Peter Robinson: Peter Thiel, thank you. Join us for part 2. This is a sentence I never thought I'd utter.

[00:46:39] Join us for part two to hear about the Antichrist, for Uncommon Knowledge,

[00:46:44] the Hoover Institution and Fox Nation, I'm Peter Robinson.
