[Peter Thiel on the Triumph of the Counter-Elites](https://youtu.be/wwJV_NuN43Y)

[00:00:00] from the free press this is honestly and I'm Barry Weiss

[00:00:04] president elect Donald Trump announcing the appointments of additional

[00:00:07] members of his administration today tonight Trump announcing that

[00:00:11] a department of government efficiency will be led by Tesla CEO

[00:00:15] Elon Musk and FC ramaswami on Tuesday

[00:00:18] night Donald Trump announced that the richest man in the world Elon

[00:00:22] Musk along with entrepreneur and former presidential candidate

[00:00:26] VC ramaswami will head a new Department in the trumpet

[00:00:30] Administration they're calling it the department of government

[00:00:33] efficiency or Doge Dogecoin is surging as you

[00:00:37] might know following the president-elect's victory getting an extra boost following

[00:00:40] some headlines around Elon Musk so we saw Dogecoin surge as much as 20%

[00:00:45] on Tuesday night right after Donald Trump formally announced the department of government

[00:00:49] efficiency which he called Doge in a hat tip to the dog

[00:00:53] themed meme coin aside from the very strange fact that internet

[00:00:56] meme culture has now landed in the White House Doge coin is

[00:01:00] a meme coin and if you don't understand what I just said fear not I'm sure Nelly will

[00:01:03] cover it in TGIF tomorrow but what the announcement solidifies

[00:01:07] if Trump's win hadn't already is the Triumph of the counter

[00:01:12] Elite in other words a bunch of Oddball Outsiders

[00:01:16] pulled together got behind Trump and ran

[00:01:19] against an insular band of outof touch Elites supported

[00:01:23] by every celebrity in Hollywood and the

[00:01:27] oddballs won and they're about to reach shape not

[00:01:30] just the government but also American culture

[00:01:34] in ways I don't think we can fully imagine

[00:01:38] how they did that and why is a question that I've been

[00:01:41] thinking about pretty much non-stop since last Tuesday

[00:01:45] and there was one person more than any other that I wanted to

[00:01:49] discuss it with and that is the Vanguard of those anti-establishment

[00:01:53] counter Elites Peter teal people

[00:01:56] describe the billionaire venture capitalist in very colorful terms

[00:02:00] he's been called the most successful Tech investor in the world and

[00:02:04] also a political kingmaker others call him the boogie

[00:02:07] man of the left but he is the center of gravity

[00:02:11] at least in a certain part of Silicon Valley and he's created a

[00:02:15] kind of world around him there's the teal verse teal

[00:02:19] bucks and teis to say he's an obsessive cult

[00:02:22] following would be an understatement if you listen to my

[00:02:26] last conversation with teal a year and a half ago on this show

[00:02:29] you'll remember that Peter was the first person in Silicon Valley

[00:02:33] to publicly Embrace Trump in 2016 I'm

[00:02:37] Peter teal I build companies and I support people who

[00:02:40] are building new things from social networks to rocket

[00:02:44] ships I'm not a politician but neither

[00:02:48] is Donald Trump he is a builder

[00:02:52] and it's time to rebuild America that year he

[00:02:55] gave a very memorable speech at the RNC every

[00:02:59] American has a unique identity I am proud

[00:03:03] to be gay I am proud to be a republican

[00:03:06] a speech that many in his orbit thought was a step

[00:03:10] way too far and he suffered for it he lost

[00:03:14] business at the startup incubator Y combinator where he was a partner

[00:03:18] many prominent Tech leaders criticized him publicly like VC

[00:03:22] and Twitter investor Chris Saka who called Teal's endorsement of

[00:03:25] trump one of the most dangerous things he had ever seen

[00:03:30] Jason calacanis one of the hosts of the all-in podcast wrote at

[00:03:33] the time if you are backing Trump you are choosing the side of

[00:03:37] hate racism and misogyny there is no compromise

[00:03:41] on this issue calanis wrote It's not a difference of political

[00:03:45] opinion it's about what kind of human being you want

[00:03:48] to be well a lot has changed since then

[00:03:52] for one teal has taken a step back from politics

[00:03:56] at least publicly he didn't donate to Trump's campaign this time around

[00:04:00] and there was no big RNC speech but the bigger change I'd

[00:04:04] argue is a cultural one teal is no longer the paria

[00:04:08] of Silicon Valley for supporting Trump there's Bill Amman

[00:04:11] Mark Andries David saaks sha Maguire and

[00:04:15] of course Elon Musk among many other Tech Titans

[00:04:19] some of whom used to support the Democrats who have joined the Trump train

[00:04:23] on the surface teal is someone who seems full of contradictions

[00:04:27] or at least paradoxes he's a libertarian who is found common

[00:04:30] cause with nationalists and populists he likes investing in

[00:04:34] companies that have the ability to become monopolies and yet Trump's

[00:04:38] White House wants to break up big Tech he's a gay American immigrant

[00:04:42] but he hates identity politics and also the culture wars

[00:04:46] he pays people to drop out of college but also in this conversation

[00:04:50] seems to still venerate the ivy league but perhaps that's

[00:04:54] the secret to his success he's beholden to no tribe but

[00:04:57] himself no ideology but his own and

[00:05:01] why wouldn't you be when you make so many winning bets from

[00:05:05] co-founding the epayment Behemoth PayPal and the data

[00:05:08] analytics firm paler which was used to find Osama Bin Laden

[00:05:12] to being the first outside investor in Facebook Teal's investments

[00:05:17] in companies like LinkedIn paler and SpaceX to name a few

[00:05:21] have paid off big time his most recent bet

[00:05:25] helping his mentee JD Vance get elected senator of Ohio

[00:05:29] and then Vice President of the United States seems

[00:05:33] to have paid off big time I guess the next four years

[00:05:36] will determine just how high Teal's profit margin will be

[00:05:40] today Peter teal explains why so many of his peers have

[00:05:44] finally come around to Trump why he thinks Kamala and

[00:05:47] liberalism more broadly lost the election we talk about

[00:05:51] the southern border tariffs and trade deals student

[00:05:54] debt Israel and foreign policy the rise of historical

[00:05:58] revisionism on the right the blurry line between skepticism

[00:06:02] and conspiracy and his contrarian ideas

[00:06:06] about what a dreaded World War II might look like

[00:06:10] this is a conversation you will not want to miss stay with

[00:06:15] [Music]

[00:06:18] us Peter teal welcome to honestly thanks for having

[00:06:22] me Barry thanks for making the time okay we last spoke I don't know if you

[00:06:26] remember this we were in Miami it was May of 2023

[00:06:30] and the world was a very different place Joe Biden was the president and he was

[00:06:33] the presumptive Democratic nominee there was a Republican primary underway

[00:06:38] you were supporting Ronda santz but you weren't being very loud about it

[00:06:42] and you know Trump was sort of on the outs with a lot of

[00:06:46] people the amount that has changed over the past year and a half

[00:06:50] is profound six months after our conversation October

[00:06:53] 7th happened it felt like the world sort of shifted on its axis

[00:06:58] then Trump won the GOP nomin in July Biden dropped

[00:07:01] out of the race Kamala was coronated of course Trump survived

[00:07:05] this wild assassination attempt near my hometown in

[00:07:09] Butler Pennsylvania and then last week was the election and

[00:07:13] Trump not only won the White House he won the popular

[00:07:16] vote and now it looks like the Republicans are poised to control all

[00:07:20] three branches of government I think it's an understatement to say that

[00:07:23] we're living in a changed world I think and the reason that

[00:07:27] I wanted to sit down with you today is that you saw saw so many of those

[00:07:31] changes coming and you can make an argument that you maybe saw them even

[00:07:34] too early um so I want to start with the kind of a broad

[00:07:38] question which is how are you feeling about this political

[00:07:41] moment that we're in I I wouldn't say I'm ecstatic but I'm relieved

[00:07:46] I I think I would be incredibly depressed if the election had gone the

[00:07:49] other way and you know it's it's probably a little bit asymmetric I would been we

[00:07:53] I'm less happy than I would be unhappy had it gone

[00:07:57] gone the other way um you know I never actually supported uh DeSantis

[00:08:01] I I did meet with him a couple of times maybe toyed with the idea

[00:08:05] a little bit DeSantis felt promising in early 2021

[00:08:08] when he was sort of the courageous covid governor and

[00:08:12] by early 2023 um it felt

[00:08:15] like he was a little bit too locked in on these on these culture

[00:08:19] wars and I I didn't believe that that was

[00:08:23] you know they're important but they're not the most important thing and so it it

[00:08:26] already felt very very off in um in early

[00:08:30] in early 2023 to me were you surprised by what happened

[00:08:33] on Tuesday night cuz some have credited you for predicting it you said it was

[00:08:37] going to kind of be a blowout in One Direction or the other I didn't think it was going to be that close

[00:08:41] and uh and I suppose I didn't think that Harris was going to win by

[00:08:45] a big margin so if you combine those two things it's a way of saying that

[00:08:48] I I thought it was going to be a solid win for Trump I mean

[00:08:52] you know um he was way behind in the polls in 2016

[00:08:56] and 2020 and both of those were you know extremely

[00:09:00] close and if you just believe the polls hadn't been

[00:09:04] fully adjusted and they hadn't fully corrected whatever mistake they were

[00:09:07] making in the polling from four or eight years ago um

[00:09:11] and the polls were even that suggested you know that suggested it was going

[00:09:14] to be a very very solid win and then and then on some

[00:09:18] level I think it was just a collapse of liberalism you know say say

[00:09:22] more I mean of liberalism or of the democra liberalism the Democratic

[00:09:26] party I I think it's too narrow to blame it on

[00:09:29] you know a somewhat scile Biden and a you know somewhat

[00:09:33] goofy kamla Harris um and

[00:09:37] it was sort of just a you know some somehow it was just this much broader collapse

[00:09:41] it feels like a much more decisive election you know in a way you can say in

[00:09:44] 2016 Trump beat the Republicans the bush

[00:09:48] Republicans and um he sort of maybe lucked out or snuck

[00:09:52] by Hillary and um she didn't take him seriously

[00:09:56] at all you can't say that about 2024 everyone knew

[00:09:59] it was going to be the Midwest states Pennsylvania Wisconsin Michigan

[00:10:04] the Democrats gave it their all they you know spent two or three times

[00:10:07] as much money as Trump spent the last you know three four months

[00:10:11] and uh it it just didn't work they certainly

[00:10:15] the institutions try to prosecute him prosecute him criminally

[00:10:19] they try to take get him off the bout they try to stop him in every

[00:10:23] way possible and so unlike 2016 this

[00:10:26] time it was Trump against the Democrats the Democrats gave it their

[00:10:30] all and uh and it it just collapsed you

[00:10:34] know one other dimension of it that's so so many different observations

[00:10:37] one can make but one other dimension of it that I find striking

[00:10:41] is uh is that if we talked about this in 2016 would be

[00:10:45] you know the Republicans are this party of white voters and old voters

[00:10:49] and they're going to die um and eventually they'll be

[00:10:53] replaced by younger and more diverse Democrats

[00:10:56] this was the whole demographics is Destiny argument and so for

[00:11:00] Trump to be able and eight years is actually a long time and there are

[00:11:04] you know a lot of Republican voters from 2016 who are not alive anymore

[00:11:08] and so for Trump to be able to win in 2024

[00:11:12] and by a much more significant margin at least

[00:11:15] in the popular vote than in in um 2016

[00:11:19] it means you had to change the minds of millions of people

[00:11:23] and you had to do something that if you believe that demographics Destiny

[00:11:26] or identity politics means that people cannot listen to reason

[00:11:31] and it's all subject to these subrational factors like your race

[00:11:34] or your gender or your sexual orientation or something like this

[00:11:38] then nobody would ever be able to change their mind you you exploded

[00:11:43] the LIE of identity politics that um you know

[00:11:47] your identity matters more than the argument or the case

[00:11:50] and and Trump made an argument JD man made an

[00:11:54] argument they made a made a strong case and I think there was

[00:11:57] no argument on the Democrat atic side it was it was free of

[00:12:01] substance free of ideas you know people people say

[00:12:05] that uh that Harris struggled in saying

[00:12:08] how she was different from Biden how she was substantively

[00:12:12] different from Biden but you know it's that that's that's too narrow way of

[00:12:16] putting it she had nothing to say of substance on anything

[00:12:20] and so obviously if you have zero substance then there's also zero substantive difference with

[00:12:24] Biden I want to pick up on the idea of the democratic party maybe even liberalism

[00:12:27] collapsed it's you know one striking

[00:12:31] there there's so many striking visuals of this campaign but I think

[00:12:35] one of them is when you look at the murderer row of

[00:12:39] celebrities and the pretty people that were lined

[00:12:42] up behind the Democratic ticket whether it's

[00:12:46] it's literally everyone it's Oprah it's Beyonce it's you name a Hollywood

[00:12:50] celebrity there you go and on the other side yes you had a

[00:12:53] few sort of dissonant from the elite like Elon Musk

[00:12:58] but you had you know podcasters you had

[00:13:01] my pillow guy you had you know not

[00:13:05] anyone that people would maybe choose

[00:13:09] uh if they were thinking about who to who to seek endorsements from the sort

[00:13:12] of Curry's popular favor what does that say about like where the culture is

[00:13:16] yeah I mean look these things are always very overdetermined but but I I would say

[00:13:20] it it tells us that celebrity isn't what it used to be

[00:13:24] and uh celebrity used to have a certain mystique

[00:13:28] and it has been somewhat deconstructed and we

[00:13:31] you know we think of a lot of the Hollywood celebrities a lot of

[00:13:35] the you know music celebrities as um

[00:13:39] as just these um you know leftwing ditto heads

[00:13:43] um and um you know they may be smart people they're not

[00:13:47] allowed to articulate smart things they're not allowed to be

[00:13:51] individuals and uh you know one one of the

[00:13:55] the Striking thing is I I don't think there is room

[00:13:59] for individual thought left on the left and

[00:14:02] um it's certainly not in Hollywood and I think you know Hollywood in the 1990s

[00:14:06] it was liberal but you know behind closed doors you could say

[00:14:10] very transgressive things and you realize it was this liberal show

[00:14:13] you were putting on and then there parts of it you believed and parts of it that

[00:14:17] you could question I don't think people are able to have

[00:14:21] uh conversations even in small groups at dinners

[00:14:24] behind closed doors in a liberal context people are not allowed

[00:14:28] to think for themselves same thing for University professors

[00:14:32] you know when I was I know when I was at Stanford in the ' 80s early

[00:14:36] '90s uh it was overwhelmingly liberal

[00:14:40] but you had a lot of thoughtful liberals there were still such a thing as an

[00:14:43] eccentric University professor and that's a species

[00:14:47] that's basically gone extinct and uh and

[00:14:50] then we we can go down you know down the list of Institutions

[00:14:54] you know there were you know there were Elder Statesmen type figures

[00:14:58] people who have been in the government for a long time and um were very

[00:15:01] thoughtful and had had you know a good nuanced perspective

[00:15:05] and there were all these ways this was more true on the

[00:15:09] left on the Democratic side on the liberal side than the Republican

[00:15:12] side the the progressives thought of themselves as more Elite and the

[00:15:16] smarter people and um and

[00:15:20] and uh but there's just no individuality left whatsoever

[00:15:24] and then you know the story of people like Elon or

[00:15:29] py gabard or uh RFK Jr or may

[00:15:32] maybe yourself is um is at some point

[00:15:36] um this sort of straight jacket where you're just joining

[00:15:40] the Borg is not what you signed up when when you started

[00:15:43] as a liberals you know I've known Elon since 2000

[00:15:47] 24 almost 25 years and um

[00:15:51] you know he was not never doctrinaire but for the first

[00:15:54] 20 years you know he was left of center

[00:15:58] um you know was he was a Tesla was a Clean Energy

[00:16:02] electric vehicle company um the Republicans

[00:16:05] were these people who didn't believe in climate change uh and

[00:16:09] and so it was it was sort of naturally much more comfortable

[00:16:13] in sort of Deep Blue Democratic

[00:16:17] California and then at some point

[00:16:21] Elon shifted and I and it's overdetermined why he shifted

[00:16:24] or why you shifted or some of these other people did I didn't shift Peter

[00:16:28] every everyone yeah but but everyone feels that way of course

[00:16:32] but but I but and I know these things are overdetermined but I but I

[00:16:36] I keep thinking part of it is just this sort of straight jacket

[00:16:39] is not what you all signed up for well this intellectual

[00:16:43] straight jacket where you're not allowed to have ideas even if

[00:16:47] you agree with 80% It's never enough you have to be 100%

[00:16:51] and uh you know one one of the other metaphors I've I've used is that you

[00:16:55] know um the the left the Democratic Party

[00:16:59] it's like the Empire they're all Imperial Stormtroopers

[00:17:02] and you know we're we're the ragtag Rebel Alliance

[00:17:06] and it is a it's a uncomfortably diverse

[00:17:10] heterogenous group and you have you know I don't know a teenage

[00:17:14] Chewbacca and a Princess Leia type character

[00:17:18] and then we have you know we have a um autistic

[00:17:22] C3PO policy wonk person and it is a

[00:17:26] you know it's it's a ragtag rebel alliance against the empire

[00:17:30] I thought a lot about I don't know if you were into the Hunger Games in the same

[00:17:33] way you were into Star Wars but like a lot of

[00:17:37] to me like the people that I know that either sat out this that were

[00:17:41] reliable Democrats and liberals who either sat out this election or

[00:17:44] voted Trump for the first time did not do it because they like Donald

[00:17:48] Trump most of them find him abhorent um they did

[00:17:52] it because they wanted to give a middle finger to the capital like in The Hunger

[00:17:55] Games analogy because they felt all of the things

[00:17:59] you're describing um and I think one of the things I'm thinking about in

[00:18:02] the aftermath of the election is you know will

[00:18:06] the Democrats sort of double down on

[00:18:10] all of the narratives and the myths that have landed them in this

[00:18:14] place you can watch it right now on MSNBC where they're still

[00:18:17] talking about they're somehow finding a way to look at black

[00:18:21] voters going to the right Latino men especially going to the

[00:18:25] right and somehow it's still a story of misogyny and white supremacy

[00:18:28] or are they going to sort of spend their time in the wilderness regrouping

[00:18:33] um in much of the way the Democrats did sort of after Carter's loss

[00:18:36] and then of course you have like you know Al from and James Carville Etc

[00:18:40] building the Clinton machine yeah although that took that took 12 years

[00:18:44] it took took a long time

[00:18:48] I don't I don't know but I I

[00:18:52] I wonder I worry that um the sort

[00:18:56] of skill for introspect reflection

[00:19:00] thought has just really really atrophied and there's

[00:19:04] you know there's but isn't losing a very good lesson

[00:19:08] in it it should be but you know somehow the Democrat it's

[00:19:11] it's it's a long history but you know the clintons

[00:19:15] in the 9s it was it was triangulation which was

[00:19:19] you know maybe a little bit nihilistic moderate compromise

[00:19:22] seeking but behind closed doors I think you had you

[00:19:26] know very smart people in the Clinton admin Administration who had debates

[00:19:30] and were able to articulate things then you got to some Centrist

[00:19:34] consensus View and there was a big shift with

[00:19:38] Obama in 2008 and you know in a way you could say

[00:19:42] there were only two people in the Obama Administration two two

[00:19:45] individuals him and her and um you know

[00:19:49] everybody else was just an NPC you were just going

[00:19:53] with the Borg and it was it was you very quickly

[00:19:57] figured out what the consent was and then it was

[00:20:01] uh rigidly enforced and it had a certain power

[00:20:05] but then uh there were all these ways it went very

[00:20:08] wrong and uh and then you know and then the Obama Legacy

[00:20:12] was that you know you got Hillary Clinton in

[00:20:16] 2016 you know probably Biden was their best candidate

[00:20:19] in 2020 was almost blocked by Obama and then in 24

[00:20:23] you ended up with uh with Harris um who you know was sort

[00:20:27] of pushed by Obama both as VP and then for president

[00:20:31] uh this last summer for my mom who I know listens to the show an NPC is

[00:20:34] a non-player character it's sort of like a zombie it's like a

[00:20:38] z like a zombie yeah I think in 2020

[00:20:42] everyone maybe not everyone but many people even those who supported

[00:20:46] Trump could tell themselves a story that his presidency was

[00:20:49] some kind of anomaly now I think

[00:20:53] with this overwhelming Victory historians are going to be

[00:20:57] telling themselves a very different story well say it was the 2020

[00:21:00] was the fluke right explain that well it's uh

[00:21:04] yeah this is what seemed important to me about the 2024 election because

[00:21:08] uh I think the Hollywood movie term is redning retroactive

[00:21:12] continuity and it's uh it's like you have a you have a popular character

[00:21:15] who dies in an avalanche but the people want him back and then we somehow find a way

[00:21:19] for him to survive and make it back and uh you may and

[00:21:22] then you come up with a way to make it retroactively continuous

[00:21:26] so we have to tell a story of what happened the last 8

[00:21:30] years and if Harris had

[00:21:34] won the story would have been 2016 was a

[00:21:37] fluke we can ignore it and you know

[00:21:41] liberalism is basically fine and we can go back to the

[00:21:45] sort of somewhat brain dead but comfortable

[00:21:48] Obama consensus and uh and it seems

[00:21:52] to me that uh the the straightforward

[00:21:56] retroactively continuous story is that 2020 was the

[00:21:59] fluke and it was it was one last time

[00:22:03] for this onen regime with a you know

[00:22:07] aen President Biden to daughter

[00:22:11] over the Finish Line one last time um but

[00:22:14] it was not you know it was not a sign of Health at all

[00:22:18] you were able to put it together there were all these paradoxes

[00:22:22] you know um maybe one of the one of the crazy paradoxes of

[00:22:27] um of the diversity politics

[00:22:30] is that uh it you know is that if

[00:22:34] you one of the lessons of the last three elections for Democrats is

[00:22:38] maybe they can only elect old straight white

[00:22:42] men and um and the logic of it

[00:22:45] would be that uh if you if you

[00:22:49] if you go with a diverse person you always have to go with a specific category let's

[00:22:53] say KLA Harris is a black woman but maybe

[00:22:56] that doesn't mean that much from my as a gay guy or

[00:23:00] um maybe um maybe it's alienating to Latinos

[00:23:04] or something like this and so as soon as you concretize

[00:23:08] this abstract idea of a diverse person into a specific person

[00:23:12] um you lose way more people than you get I mean I don't know it's maybe 7%

[00:23:16] of our population are black women

[00:23:19] and so yeah maybe Harris helps with 7%

[00:23:23] and but then isn't the logic of identity politics

[00:23:27] that it should hurt you with the other 93% if you say you should

[00:23:31] vote for candidate X because candidate X shares your trait

[00:23:35] but I think one of the interesting things about this election unlike the Hillary Clinton

[00:23:39] election which was all about sort of girl boss lean in female

[00:23:42] power empowerment KLA Harris you know almost

[00:23:46] didn't talk about it no it obvious no it obviously didn't work anymore

[00:23:50] but I I think yeah I think I think the last time the identity politics worked

[00:23:55] for real was probably the 2008 election with with with

[00:23:58] Obama and it worked because in 2008 it

[00:24:02] we were still in a pre-internet world and a pre-internet world

[00:24:06] meant you could tell one message to one group of people and a different

[00:24:10] message to a different group of people and so for black voters Obama

[00:24:13] could say he was a black person and they should vote for him because he was black

[00:24:17] like them and to White voters Obama could say he was a post-racial

[00:24:21] person and they should vote for him because he was post-racial

[00:24:25] um by the time you get to 2016 it doesn't

[00:24:29] actually work yeah Hillary can't tell um you

[00:24:32] know women to vote for her because she's a woman and

[00:24:36] um men to vote for her because she's a post-gender person

[00:24:40] or something like that and you know the sort of microt targeting

[00:24:44] Mark Penn political strategy from the 90s was way past its

[00:24:48] cellb cell by date in 2016 so yeah so somehow

[00:24:52] um although I will say both presidential candidates interestingly

[00:24:55] in this election sort of had one message

[00:24:59] for Arab Muslim voters certainly in parts of Michigan and a very different

[00:25:02] message for Jewish voters in the same state

[00:25:07] so I'm just wondering if the rule always

[00:25:11] holds that that one is that one is

[00:25:15] complicated I suppose and we can analyze in a lot of ways but

[00:25:19] I I suppose it's it's it's it's evidence of just

[00:25:22] the total collapse of the democratic party if you lose

[00:25:26] ground among both Jews and Muslims like how do you do

[00:25:29] that and um and uh and

[00:25:33] I can come up with all sorts of ways to explain it but

[00:25:37] let's just say as a fact it it it sort of suggests to you

[00:25:40] that wow if you can't even gain with one of those groups

[00:25:44] at the expense of the other this whole identity politics thing has gone

[00:25:48] super super Haywire but yeah it's you know comma

[00:25:52] didn't know how to how to talk about it

[00:25:56] in in the right way and maybe maybe there was there was no way

[00:26:00] no good way to do it but but I don't think this is a conversation they can have

[00:26:03] on the Democratic side because Biden was the Compromise he was

[00:26:07] the old straight white male and the promise was he's

[00:26:11] going to be the last one we'll ever have we need him this one time to get through in 2020

[00:26:15] so somehow they knew that this was the most electable person in

[00:26:19] 2020 and then of course we'll get a more diverse person after

[00:26:23] Biden but then sort of two three four

[00:26:26] 2023 wow it's anybody post Biden is worse than

[00:26:30] Biden and then it's only when the senility really really catches

[00:26:34] up that we have to do something and um and then

[00:26:38] and then somehow the consensus shifted very quickly to we don't

[00:26:42] have time for a primary therefore we have to go with kamla haris

[00:26:45] Harris therefore we have to have this wishful thinking that she's the

[00:26:49] most wonderful candidate ever even though that's not something we beli for the three and a half

[00:26:53] years before and um and then you know

[00:26:56] it works for a few weeks but then unravels pretty pretty badly as we

[00:27:00] all saw just one hypo and then I'll move on

[00:27:04] I guess I'm curious if you think the X Factor in this election

[00:27:08] was Trump or kamala's weakness in other words if

[00:27:11] Trump had been running against let's say Pennsylvania Governor

[00:27:15] Josh Shapiro or someone like a West Moore or perhaps

[00:27:19] even a Gavin Nome would it still have been a

[00:27:24] blowout you it's always hard to do these counterfactuals but

[00:27:28] my my intuition is that it was it was a

[00:27:31] it was a broader failing of the democratic party

[00:27:35] it was not just Biden's fault it was not just Harris's fault

[00:27:40] uh I don't think I think all these people

[00:27:44] are not that impressive you know if if we if we go

[00:27:47] with Elite credentialing uh you know

[00:27:51] JD Vance went to Yale law school

[00:27:55] if president Trump were here he would tell you went to Penn

[00:27:59] it's an Ivy League school yes he would you can't you can't be a dummy and

[00:28:02] they only take the smartest of the smart people there and he tell

[00:28:06] you that and um and you know I don't

[00:28:10] know in the 90s Bill Clinton was Yale law Road

[00:28:14] scholar um Obama was Harvard Law Hillary

[00:28:17] Clinton was Yale law they had impressive Elite

[00:28:21] credentials and there was a collapse with Biden

[00:28:25] I think in retrospect we can say it was a transition from smart to dumb

[00:28:29] or Elite to non- Elite and it was University

[00:28:33] of Delaware and then commo is

[00:28:37] um Howard UC Hastings law school

[00:28:40] um walz even dumber even more mediocre

[00:28:44] and um there is nothing Elite left and I think I you know

[00:28:48] I don't know Gavin Newsome was University of Santa Clara not a very elite

[00:28:51] place at all um Shapiro was a little bit smarter

[00:28:55] but it's like Georgetown Law School which is still a

[00:28:59] lot less Elite than um than but this is hilarious

[00:29:02] because you're someone who does not believe in the

[00:29:06] like in in the fact that these places should still hold the prestige that they do

[00:29:10] you think that they're corrupt and rotten so square square the Paradox

[00:29:14] that's coming through here I can I can believe they're corrupt and rotten

[00:29:18] and uh and that they still select for very smart people and and

[00:29:22] and and find it amazing that the Democrats no longer believe

[00:29:25] in them and that they've come around to my point of view that there's

[00:29:29] or maybe that they are so rotten that they they are

[00:29:33] no longer good places to learn how to defend liberalism maybe

[00:29:37] maybe there are good places for training conservatives you know if if you go

[00:29:40] to Yale law school and if you're one of you know

[00:29:44] five people in the class of 170 who's still conservative at the end

[00:29:48] you'll be pretty good at understanding what's wrong with liberalism you'll have thought about it a

[00:29:52] lot and you'll be a more thoughtful person and so it will actually train you

[00:29:55] well to be a conservative and we're right right to to Value

[00:29:59] the you know the small number of conservatives who come out of that that Gauntlet

[00:30:03] as as quite talented people but um you know if you're if you're a

[00:30:07] liberal and you graduate from from any of these places

[00:30:11] I don't think you you would do a better job defending liberalism and

[00:30:15] it wouldn't some you know so I don't know um I don't know who the smartest

[00:30:18] young Liberals are Pete Buddha jig if you know if you try to make him

[00:30:22] Square the circle and defend you know the incredible deficits the

[00:30:26] inflation you know the outof control border you know all the substantive policy

[00:30:30] that were wrong it would be more embarrassing than Harris

[00:30:34] because we expect Budig to be smart and it would just show how

[00:30:38] incoherent it is you know if it's word salad coming out of Harris

[00:30:42] maybe we can blame it on Harris um if you had someone really

[00:30:45] smart it would be more embarrassing so maybe maybe the Liberals were

[00:30:49] correct to say that they could no longer pick someone from an elite school because

[00:30:52] it would it would sort of blow up all of liberalism whereas now we can

[00:30:56] still pretend that it was you know just the fault of Biden or

[00:31:00] Harris I I think although I think it was much broader than that I think I

[00:31:03] think the whole thing is how you go bankrupt gradually then suddenly

[00:31:08] and and at some point it's just

[00:31:12] passed the cell by date and it's over and you know it's somehow

[00:31:16] I don't know the 20th century lasted it was it went

[00:31:20] on in this zombie way for like another 20 years in the 2000s

[00:31:23] and 2010s and somehow you know the 20th

[00:31:27] century is actually over and uh and this sort of

[00:31:31] New Deal liberalism political

[00:31:34] correct leftism this whole constellation of you

[00:31:38] know um the progressive cult that is the

[00:31:42] University you know the these things have have finally

[00:31:45] unraveled and there there people like me who are

[00:31:49] you in some ways oppositional to this or fighting this for

[00:31:53] a long time and and uh and

[00:31:57] it's it's it's of and felt like man this stuff never changes you

[00:32:00] know I start I started the teal Fellowship uh to encourage kids to drop

[00:32:04] out of college in 2010 and I remember 2019 N9 years later I was

[00:32:08] at this event at MIT and the University president was talking it

[00:32:12] was all these bromides it was like it was 2005 and

[00:32:15] man we're never going to make progress these institutions you know they're unreformable

[00:32:20] but they don't need to reform and uh and five years

[00:32:23] later you know the collapse has been has been pretty big

[00:32:27] and it's it's hard I I don't see how how it recovers

[00:32:31] I you know they will they will figure something out but it's not

[00:32:34] obvious how they will I mean something I've been thinking about a lot since Tuesday night is

[00:32:38] like does Peter teal feel Vindicated in this

[00:32:50] moment I I um

[00:32:59] sure sure but but you know I I think there are me is

[00:33:03] that an embarrassing thing to answer yes to well it's it's you you must

[00:33:07] feel Vindicated I mean here's here's how I was thinking about

[00:33:10] it like in 2016 you were

[00:33:14] the boogeyman okay MH I'm sure you were called

[00:33:17] that in a million articles but that's what it was and you were sort

[00:33:21] of alone as the maybe the way i'

[00:33:25] think about you as like the Vanguard of the counter Elite you were you made history

[00:33:28] you were at the RNC you were the first gay man to ever speak at the RNC

[00:33:32] and it didn't lead to a Cascade of other people let say

[00:33:35] standing with you and this election you have

[00:33:40] Bill Amman Mark Andre Elon Musk I want to talk

[00:33:43] in a little bit about what created that shift but you were ahead arguably

[00:33:47] by eight years there's no in my view there's no way you couldn't feel

[00:33:51] Vindicated yeah I think I think the um

[00:33:55] well I I think the fantasy I had

[00:33:59] in 2016 was something like

[00:34:03] there were there were all these deep substantive problems that I think

[00:34:06] exist in our society I think our society is too stagnant we're not

[00:34:10] making enough progress there's a way the intergenerational compact

[00:34:13] has broken down the younger generation is finding it um much harder

[00:34:17] to get their footing and um and yeah there's sort

[00:34:21] of all these ways that our society is no longer

[00:34:24] progressing the economy is not doing as well all all sorts of

[00:34:28] different variations of this problem of stagnation or

[00:34:32] even outright decline that I I'd been talking about for a while

[00:34:36] and uh and I think my fantasy in

[00:34:40] 2016 was that um

[00:34:43] Trump was was a way for us to force a conversation

[00:34:47] about the stagnation um you know make America great again

[00:34:51] was the most pessimistic slogan that any

[00:34:56] any presidential candidate certainly any Republican candidate had had in a 100

[00:34:59] years because it was maybe you were going to make it great

[00:35:03] again but you're going to start by saying we are no longer a great country

[00:35:07] I felt it was a politic it was this powerful political

[00:35:11] way of articulating this problem of stagnation you know what do you do

[00:35:14] about it hard to say first step is you talk about it first

[00:35:18] you how do we make our country great don't know but probably first step

[00:35:22] is not as great as we think we are and then maybe we can become great

[00:35:26] again if we sort of level set and admit where we are

[00:35:30] and uh and so that was sort of my fantasy and

[00:35:34] then I I don't think I don't think the country was remotely

[00:35:38] ready for this and certainly not the Democratic part of the country I I don't

[00:35:41] know if they're I don't know if the Democrats are ready for it I think

[00:35:45] the country as a whole is and uh and and so

[00:35:48] there you know there is there is sort of summit mission that man there was a

[00:35:52] lot of stuff that Trump was right about there's a lot of stuff where

[00:35:56] things sure feel feel like they're on the wrong track

[00:36:00] and uh and I I I think that's where we are in a very very different

[00:36:04] place let's talk a little bit about the shift that happened

[00:36:07] in Silicon Valley okay because I think it what happened

[00:36:11] is what's called a preference Cascade you probably know that term

[00:36:14] better than me but it's essentially when when several

[00:36:18] people maybe a group of people around the same time realize

[00:36:22] they're not the only one and in fact you know

[00:36:25] maybe they represent if not majority a powerful minority

[00:36:29] and I remember I remember it very clearly because it was the day our

[00:36:33] son was born our son was born in a few hours later um

[00:36:36] Trump got shot at in in Butler and I watched

[00:36:40] as people who had sort of all of the Aesthetics had been indicating

[00:36:44] to me that they were Trump supporters but all of a sudden with the picture

[00:36:48] of trump and all of them retweeting it it became

[00:36:51] oh my God like abundantly clear as one after the other sort of started to

[00:36:55] basically endorse him with this picture yes explain that

[00:36:59] phenomenon to me because like me I'm sure you know lots

[00:37:03] of people who have sort of like one Politics

[00:37:06] on Signal or WhatsApp and another politics in public

[00:37:10] and I felt like over the course of basically from July to

[00:37:14] the election the gap between those things sort of radically narrowed

[00:37:18] what happened yeah it's

[00:37:22] um it's probably something like what what you described it's

[00:37:25] uh there was some degree to which um it

[00:37:29] was safer for people to speak out when other people were speaking out

[00:37:33] you know once once you know if you know

[00:37:36] you're lying and you know that everybody's lying and you know that everybody

[00:37:40] knows that everybody knows that everybody's lying um you know at some point

[00:37:44] it becomes pretty unstable and it can just all of a sudden

[00:37:48] you know shift pretty fast into was Elon

[00:37:52] the critical ingredient did he give people cover I think

[00:37:56] Elon was incredibly important to it

[00:38:01] uh I think there was a there were a lot of pieces that

[00:38:04] had that had built built up in in Silicon

[00:38:08] Valley uh there was a you know there's always there was

[00:38:11] always a way where um for many years people

[00:38:15] had been doubling down on the wokeness the

[00:38:19] political correctness you know inside these companies

[00:38:22] and um and and then it's always an ambiguous

[00:38:26] thing if something is not working let's say wokeness isn't

[00:38:30] really working it's not making your employees happier

[00:38:34] and more productive and more constructive and it's instead deranging

[00:38:38] it but the ambiguity is does that mean you need to have more

[00:38:41] wokeness or do you need to cut it out all together and

[00:38:45] for you know for a number of years um the intuition was

[00:38:50] well we just have to do a little bit more and we have to try a little bit harder and

[00:38:53] do a little bit more and then you know there's there's

[00:38:57] some point where it just got exhausted and

[00:39:01] uh and certainly certainly a lot of the uh

[00:39:05] the um the top Tech Founders and CEOs

[00:39:09] felt comfortable telling me this behind closed doors and maybe they're just telling me things

[00:39:13] that I want to hear but I tend of think they're telling me what they really think

[00:39:16] and um and so I was yeah was very aware of this

[00:39:20] incredible disconnect and it was in Silicon Valley I think it was a lot of it

[00:39:23] was um experienced as corporate

[00:39:27] governance as you know how ridiculous it's gotten to

[00:39:31] manage these um ideologically deranged Millennial

[00:39:35] employees and you know uh There Was You know I I won't

[00:39:39] I'll try not to name names but you know one one of the bigger companies that was in San

[00:39:43] Francisco you know um the people in 2017

[00:39:47] the founders told me you know was you know they weren't sure they could take any more money from me

[00:39:50] because I supported Trump and it was sort of difficult to explain to their employees

[00:39:55] but it was about a 12-month period by by 2019 you know

[00:39:58] they hadn't shifted to being pro Trump but it was they really appreciated

[00:40:02] my courage and they um they they organized their company

[00:40:06] where you know they had uh the hiring goals were

[00:40:10] to shift employees away from San Francisco Bay Area as fast as

[00:40:14] possible so we are we have x% of people working

[00:40:18] in San Francisco and we want to reduce that

[00:40:21] percentage as quickly as possible for a company as big as we

[00:40:25] are and and that was and then you know

[00:40:28] if we if we build our employee Workforce in any

[00:40:32] place other than San Francisco it'll be less woke and less crazy

[00:40:36] and more productive and and so this was the kind of just very prosaic

[00:40:40] conversation you had about you know how to how to manage a company

[00:40:44] and then and then at some point um

[00:40:47] at some point we got the preference Cascade that was was 2024

[00:40:51] but yeah OB obviously Elon gave um gave people

[00:40:55] a great deal of cover you know there's I mean I mean

[00:40:59] it certainly it certainly seemed incredibly dangerous

[00:41:02] to me what he did incredibly courageous you know what would have happened

[00:41:06] to him if um if if Trump would have lost

[00:41:10] and then um and then and then certainly uh it uh

[00:41:14] it was well you know may maybe all all the rest of us can be a little bit

[00:41:17] more courageous than we otherwise were going to be but he he gave

[00:41:21] cover to everybody one of the things that was being said on both

[00:41:25] sides before the election by Oprah and Elon and

[00:41:29] they sounded different saying it but it was the same message was that if

[00:41:32] their candidate didn't win this was going to be the last American

[00:41:38] election I thought that was

[00:41:42] totally nuts but maybe you

[00:41:47] don't um or maybe you hear

[00:41:51] it differently let me

[00:41:54] I I didn't want to believe

[00:41:58] Elon when he said this and I you know I I

[00:42:01] texted him a few weeks before the election and told him you know I hadn't

[00:42:05] believed you when you said this at first but it's but I I think it's

[00:42:09] because psychologically I don't want to believe that I don't want to believe

[00:42:12] that the country is so far gone that you have to leave the

[00:42:16] country or something and um but then it was

[00:42:20] the sense in which I I felt that he was he was correct

[00:42:24] was that if um

[00:42:28] if Trump with what I think but much better substance

[00:42:32] much better on so many things um

[00:42:35] could not win in 2024 Against the

[00:42:39] Machine um the machine would always win and if the machine

[00:42:43] always wins you no longer have a democracy you know you certainly

[00:42:46] no longer have a democratic process within the Democratic party you know we

[00:42:50] always debate the election Shenanigans in November of 2020

[00:42:54] the far more extraordinary thing was March of 2020 where Biden

[00:42:57] comes in fourth place fifth place in Iowa New Hampshire and then somehow gets

[00:43:01] rammed through South Carolina all the other candidates drop

[00:43:05] off so this is the extremely non-democratic Primary

[00:43:09] in the Democratic party in 2020 and then an even less

[00:43:12] Democratic process by which Biden was replaced with Harris

[00:43:17] and uh and yeah it was going to be this um and if if

[00:43:20] the machine could um could defeat Trump

[00:43:25] I I thought it was reasonable that it would gain even more power

[00:43:28] and somehow be unbeatable and you know the country

[00:43:32] would be would become California become a onep party State

[00:43:36] and it would be far worse than California because the constraint on California

[00:43:40] is people can leave California it's much harder to leave the us when you

[00:43:43] say the machine explain what you mean by

[00:43:48] that it's um well it's

[00:43:52] it's it's it's sort of a question of what it

[00:43:56] what is actually going going on in the Democratic party

[00:43:59] or in this Progressive cult that is the left

[00:44:03] and maybe a cult is is too kind a word because you know

[00:44:06] a cult normally has a cult leader there's like Le one person who's thinking

[00:44:10] inside a cult the cult leader and uh

[00:44:14] it is again it's a machine because there are no individuals

[00:44:18] and it's like you know it's like um you are just

[00:44:22] a small Cog in the machine and you're destined to become an Ever smaller

[00:44:26] COG in this ever bigger machine and that's that's kind of

[00:44:30] that's kind of uh the vibe of it and uh

[00:44:34] and it doesn't you know ideas don't matter um

[00:44:37] debates don't matter you know speech doesn't

[00:44:41] matter it's it's it's it's it's it's just some

[00:44:45] kind of fast consensus formation process

[00:44:49] we we get to an answer and then um and then we

[00:44:53] uh we rigorously enforce it I you know it's

[00:44:56] it's always too extreme to describe like the Communist party or something like this but it is

[00:45:00] it's just this extremely regimented process

[00:45:04] that's um you know somehow not very Democratic

[00:45:08] not very thoughtful not very Republican you know not very

[00:45:12] American okay one of the things that interested

[00:45:16] me about your role in this election cycle is

[00:45:19] you know when you look back at 2016 you were all in

[00:45:23] right you gave you know tens of millions of

[00:45:28] between Trump and then I think 16 Republican candidates including

[00:45:32] senator now VP elect JD Vans who will get to but you sat

[00:45:36] this presidential election cycle out and you were at the Aspen ideas Festival

[00:45:39] not a place that I expect to see you um and you said

[00:45:43] this if you hold a gun to my head I'll vote for Trump but I'm not going to give

[00:45:47] any money to his super pack why

[00:45:51] the Aspen ideas Festival it's a 75% liberal audience

[00:45:55] so even in front of it's way big more than 75%

[00:45:59] I will say when I showed up there I was like the most rightwing person

[00:46:02] if you take me literally uh Barry I I'll just make this point

[00:46:06] um and you held a gun to my head in front of a liberal audience

[00:46:09] and I would say I'm still voting for Trump even if you hold a gun to my head in front of this very

[00:46:13] liberal audience uh you better believe that I'm very very Pro

[00:46:17] Trump uh I also said that I you

[00:46:20] know I I didn't think the money would make that

[00:46:24] much of a difference and it it turned out really not

[00:46:27] to right it was it was uh it was you know

[00:46:31] Trump was insanely outspent and it it didn't

[00:46:35] matter um and um but yeah I

[00:46:39] uh I think what I mean is like you're all in in 2016

[00:46:43] and then it feels like you sort of retreated other people stepped into the breach

[00:46:46] but you retreated and if I see a pattern to your life

[00:46:50] and the bets you make you're often very early and very

[00:46:54] ahead and so I I guess I wonder what that pulling

[00:46:57] back indicates I I don't know

[00:47:01] I I art I articulated in

[00:47:05] various contexts why I thought Trump was going to win why he should

[00:47:08] win uh you know what I went on to discuss at the at the

[00:47:12] um Aspen Adas Festival the probably the thing I said that was the most scandalous

[00:47:16] was just descriptively he's going to win he's going to win by a big margin

[00:47:20] because uh for that audience you know it's always hegelian

[00:47:24] the actual is the ideal and so his and so

[00:47:28] if you say that Trump's going to win that's the way

[00:47:31] of saying Trump should win and he deserves to

[00:47:35] win and that was the and so the most scandalous thing

[00:47:38] I could have told those people was not I'm going to

[00:47:42] work really hard for Trump and it may or may not succeed the most

[00:47:46] scandalous thing I could tell them was you know Trump is on The Winning

[00:47:49] Side of history and he's going to crush it whether I help him or not so that was the most

[00:47:53] shocking thing and there were like Audible gasps when I said

[00:47:57] that to that audience you said in one interview in 2023

[00:48:01] that the Trump Administration was crazier and more dangerous than you expected

[00:48:05] what do you mean by that it it felt very unstable

[00:48:09] it felt it felt dangerous for the people who got got involved

[00:48:12] you know there were there were um you know all sorts of people who got

[00:48:16] prosecuted um people went to jail you know they probably

[00:48:20] did things that were wrong um they were also subject to

[00:48:24] crazy double standards and uh and so

[00:48:28] uh yeah there was sort of there were aspects of it that felt like you know a circular

[00:48:32] firing squad where you know it was I don't know

[00:48:36] this um you know and and so

[00:48:40] yeah there were all sorts of things where um

[00:48:43] it felt like there was a lot of uncompensated volatility for

[00:48:47] the people that uh that that that got that got involved at the

[00:48:51] time um

[00:48:54] I I I still I still have some worries

[00:48:58] that it I I I I'm I'm certain it will be much improved

[00:49:02] this time I still worry it will not be improved by enough

[00:49:06] or a different way of formulating it um would be that uh you

[00:49:10] know one of the paradoxes of our elections is the elections are always

[00:49:13] relativistic exercises it's basically two candidates which one

[00:49:17] do you like more or which one do you hate less it's more

[00:49:21] more negative which one do you hate less and um

[00:49:24] and uh and then once the elections over

[00:49:28] we have just one president and then that person gets put on this

[00:49:31] pedestal and they are always found to

[00:49:35] fall way short of that standard so elections are relativistic

[00:49:39] after the elections it's it's absolute and so I

[00:49:43] I have I have a worry in the back of my head that

[00:49:47] there are elements of that that will repeat that uh you know

[00:49:51] on a relative basis Trump was um

[00:49:55] greatly to be preferred to us you know on an absolute

[00:49:58] basis uh um there all these ways I

[00:50:02] expect him to fall short you know in some ways the problems are extremely

[00:50:06] difficult they are harder than they were eight years ago you know the uh

[00:50:10] the Border issue is out of control so you know maybe

[00:50:13] uh maybe you need to actually Deport people instead of just building a wall

[00:50:17] and that's a far more violent far more drastic thing to do

[00:50:22] and uh you know the the the the foreign policy

[00:50:25] situation is M you know I me there's a crisis in

[00:50:29] Russia Ukraine there there the Iran problems far worse

[00:50:33] than it was 8 years ago the uh the China Taiwan thing

[00:50:37] you know there sort of all these ways that it feels like the world is sleepwalking

[00:50:41] to Armageddon I think Trump is better than Harris um

[00:50:45] you know is he good enough to stop us from Armageddon

[00:50:48] I hope so not 100% sure that he's good enough one of the

[00:50:52] I think very um proper

[00:50:56] fears of those that opposed Trump was

[00:50:59] the fact that in the first Administration he had a

[00:51:03] lot of people around him who you know perhaps some

[00:51:06] on the right would view them as swamp creatures but perhaps other people me included

[00:51:10] would view them as public servants that were trying to sort of keep the keep this thing

[00:51:14] on the rails many of whom you know were burned or

[00:51:18] fired on Twitter or suffered as you said you know reputational damage

[00:51:21] things like that and the idea is like he's burned through the a list the b list

[00:51:25] the C list and who's left do you share that fear

[00:51:28] do you think that there that's that's well founded

[00:51:34] um not at all really okay I don't know I think

[00:51:38] uh I think they have I think they'll have a much

[00:51:42] stronger bench this time I think a lot

[00:51:45] of the I don't know sort of

[00:51:49] let's say establishmentarian swamp creature people they

[00:51:52] ended up with um were not that good

[00:51:56] you know I don't know and I I don't want to pick on too many individually but someone

[00:52:00] like General Mattis at defense as the defense

[00:52:04] secretary you know how

[00:52:08] bad your people skills have to be that you fall

[00:52:12] for the Elizabeth Holmes Theos fraud and you're on the board of her

[00:52:16] company and uh ge SCH fell for that too to be

[00:52:19] fair and I don't think you consider him a he was a lot older you

[00:52:23] know I I I expect you know a

[00:52:27] general I the probably ways they're too regimented I expect them to

[00:52:30] have good skills at judging people and leading people

[00:52:35] and um there aren't that many frauds in Silicon Valley that that you

[00:52:38] fall for the biggest one in the last

[00:52:43] decade you know may I mean maybe FTX I don't know that's the

[00:52:46] fair l i mean rer Murdoch fell for it too uh he he he invested

[00:52:50] and he was not not on the board but but but you know it's

[00:52:54] it's uh I I think there were sort of all these ways

[00:52:57] uh the um I I don't think these people

[00:53:02] were were that good and they were not good

[00:53:06] at at rethinking rethinking

[00:53:09] some of the priorities and uh you know I I don't I don't

[00:53:14] think you know there there are ways that

[00:53:17] Trump does not have you know a

[00:53:21] overarching ideological agenda it's not reaganite it's not

[00:53:25] a programmatic agenda but it is

[00:53:29] it is sort of a it is a there is a direction that you

[00:53:33] know the neocon

[00:53:37] interventionism um went wrong it needs to be re

[00:53:41] we need to rethink um the failures of

[00:53:44] especially the bush Republican era uh

[00:53:48] there's you know there's there's a sense that um the

[00:53:51] globalization project has gone very haywire and again it's not

[00:53:55] clear what what you do instead and there's a part

[00:53:59] of globalization in theory it was a good thing a borderless

[00:54:02] world a world in which they're No Boundaries to trade the movement

[00:54:06] of goods immigration the movement of people um

[00:54:10] Capital the movement of finance and the power of

[00:54:14] banks uh ideas free flow

[00:54:17] of information the internet so this was this was globalization in theory

[00:54:21] and then in practice so much of it somehow Got

[00:54:25] Hijacked by you know corrupt actors

[00:54:29] actors that are adversarial to the US the WTO is a free

[00:54:32] trade organization that by 2001

[00:54:36] was hijacked by communist China

[00:54:40] and uh and then there is some way the stuff needed to be rethought

[00:54:43] and again Trump I don't think had a had a great

[00:54:47] ideology on this but but directionally I believe he was correct

[00:54:50] that we needed to somehow rethink these things and the place

[00:54:54] where the swamp creatures were very unhel as they didn't want

[00:54:58] to rethink things they did not and I I think

[00:55:01] and I do think this is where the second Trump Administration

[00:55:05] but will will will be in a different place Trump's almost 80 years old he's not

[00:55:09] going to change his character and who he is and if you're someone let's

[00:55:12] say who has a great life you're may maybe you're

[00:55:16] maybe you're in Silicon Valley maybe you're looking and thinking wait wow maybe I

[00:55:20] could make a big difference in this Administration and you just see

[00:55:23] the way that he CHS through people what's going to

[00:55:27] make you overcome that this theoretical person

[00:55:31] to decide to kind of move to Washington

[00:55:34] DC and give it a shot well I like I

[00:55:38] just don't see that aspect of it changing you know I I I don't

[00:55:43] think I don't think Trump is going to change

[00:55:47] his views that strongly but again I don't I don't think he's that Pro um

[00:55:51] I mean his character not his views his character uh but

[00:55:54] I I I think they I think he was right to fire they they they they

[00:55:58] were wrong to hire a lot of the people they hired they were right to

[00:56:01] fire a lot of them because they were not aligned they were not remotely

[00:56:05] aligned with the administration you know there's there's some way to do

[00:56:08] it and there's some way not to do it you know it was I know again I don't want to

[00:56:12] pick on too many individuals but Bolton as National Security adviser

[00:56:16] he was picked because he agreed with Trump on one thing

[00:56:19] which was that Iran was a problem and he disagreed with Trump on everything

[00:56:24] else and uh

[00:56:28] I I think I think Bolton didn't have

[00:56:32] a terribly well-formed set of views on on China

[00:56:36] and uh and it was it was it was not a priority

[00:56:40] so probably disagreed with it as a priority if if nothing else

[00:56:44] and uh and then yeah maybe Trump should have known this and should not have hired

[00:56:48] Bolton um or Bolton should have been aware of it and should have

[00:56:51] been able to um figure out a way to

[00:56:55] you know to work um um you know

[00:56:59] within you know the rough direction that have been set by

[00:57:02] by Trump and uh it it it just blew up so yeah

[00:57:06] my my I My Hope Is there will be

[00:57:10] way fewer firings and they'll do they'll do a better job the first

[00:57:13] time around in 2016 you were had a

[00:57:17] hand in suggesting candidates for Trump's Administration Vanity

[00:57:21] Fair which I'm sure you don't read called you the shadow president

[00:57:25] who's in that role this time some people you know see Elon Musk camped out at Mar

[00:57:28] Lago and saying it's him other people are watching as you know

[00:57:32] potential appointees like Bridge kby are making their way

[00:57:36] to pilgrimage in Tucker Carlson's house in Maine

[00:57:39] is it him that's calling the shots who who are the people that are most influential

[00:57:43] in Trump's year right now I think Trump is calling the shots

[00:57:47] I think president Trump is calling the shots he's probably

[00:57:51] thought about it a lot more than he did when he

[00:57:54] when he came in in 2016 I'm not sure he'll get everything right

[00:57:58] but I think he is he is going to be much

[00:58:02] more focused on bringing in people that are you

[00:58:06] know roughly in sync with a program and uh

[00:58:09] I I'm I'm hopeful it'll be often a much better start but I think I think you know

[00:58:13] at the end of the day the buck stops with with Trump and this was this is

[00:58:16] a way where it is very different from Biden or what whatever

[00:58:20] the last four years we just had were okay

[00:58:24] I want to talk about some of Trump's Poli policies he campaigned on a few policies

[00:58:28] that seem very inconceivable to me

[00:58:32] one of them is this 20% tariff on all goods from other countries and

[00:58:35] a 60% tariff on goods from China should we take him

[00:58:39] you know seriously but not literally there is that going to happen and if so what

[00:58:43] does that look like well

[00:58:49] um I don't know Barry there's so many levels one can go through this

[00:58:53] um there are well maybe let's start with this is are those tariffs

[00:58:56] a good idea in your view uh

[00:59:00] they are I I think directionally they are a good idea

[00:59:04] um in in practice you you probably want

[00:59:08] to be more nuanced in you know there's some things

[00:59:11] you want to tear of some things you want to be more more careful

[00:59:15] about uh but you know there is there's a way free trade

[00:59:19] Theory from the classical economics the 19th century works and it's

[00:59:23] countries trade with each other but it assumes what it

[00:59:27] assumed was that you had comparable labor

[00:59:30] standards comparable regulations you

[00:59:34] had free flow of capital so if you make money you can invest it

[00:59:38] and then and then um the free trade Theory

[00:59:42] it implied that things would be in near equilibrium that

[00:59:46] um you wouldn't have countries with chronic trade surpluses

[00:59:50] or chronic trade deficits if you have a

[00:59:53] chronic trade deficit as the United States States has

[00:59:57] um it tells you um I think that there's

[01:00:01] you know something incredibly

[01:00:05] off in the in the Dynamics there's a political way to

[01:00:09] think about this too which is and use free trade

[01:00:13] in scare quotes there is a way that free

[01:00:16] trade as it currently operates benefits certain parts

[01:00:20] of the US and hurts other parts it we have a very

[01:00:24] strong dollar it some ways it helps Silicon Valley

[01:00:27] in some ways it helps um uh Wall Street

[01:00:32] and the financial system because um the trade deficit

[01:00:35] the current account deficit gets recycled into the US so if you have a

[01:00:39] you know if you have a multi billion dollar

[01:00:43] trade deficit and China ends up with hundreds of billions of dollars

[01:00:47] that it doesn't want to spend on us goods or services its only choice

[01:00:50] at the end of the day is to invest that money in the US the money gets

[01:00:54] invested through the banking system and the banks

[01:00:58] make money so in a way you can think of the Wall Street banks are long

[01:01:02] the trade deficit the bigger the deficit the more money they make when the

[01:01:05] deficits go down the banks blow up and something similar happened

[01:01:09] between 2006 and 2009 2006 we had an $800 billion

[01:01:13] current account deficit and basically you had to have $800 billion

[01:01:17] of fake Financial products that Wall Street had to sell where it's like a AAA

[01:01:21] rated subprime mortgage bond that some clueless

[01:01:25] Bank in Denmark buys up from from the US and

[01:01:29] at some point okay we don't really want to buy these bonds and

[01:01:32] maybe we don't want to sell Goods to the US because there's nothing we can do with the dollars

[01:01:36] the trade deficit current account deficit collapsed and then we had the uh

[01:01:40] 2008 Global financial crisis which again was at the time centered

[01:01:44] on the US the US Banks so there's sort of a way

[01:01:48] may maybe these deficits are good but the the the sectoral

[01:01:52] effect in the US is that it really helps certain parts of the US

[01:01:56] economy at the expense of others and the you

[01:02:00] know probably the you know one of the sectors that's

[01:02:04] hurt the most are these swing States Pennsylvania Ohio

[01:02:08] Michigan Wisconsin where you know they

[01:02:11] they were in the business of manufacturing of building

[01:02:16] you know Goods that in some sense had to be competitive in This

[01:02:19] Global um Global Market and

[01:02:23] and um and politically you know one way

[01:02:27] to analyze the elections in 2016 was

[01:02:30] that Trump in 2016 said we're going to do something about

[01:02:34] this Rust Belt problem in the Midwest and

[01:02:38] they failed to do much in the next four years and then

[01:02:42] those States reverted to the Democrats and then four years

[01:02:46] later in a way the Biden people did even less

[01:02:49] and so Trump's been given another chance to do something so so there's

[01:02:53] sort of a political economy way of thinking of the

[01:02:56] trade deficit where if you say what Trump

[01:03:00] needs to do or what JD Vance needs to do to get elected president

[01:03:04] 2028 is to fix the Rust Belt problem in

[01:03:08] the Midwest and maybe yeah maybe the tariffs are bad in some aggregate sense

[01:03:12] but just for the Republicans to politically win you have to do something

[01:03:15] for for uh those parts of the country um

[01:03:19] but I think you know look I think I think the other

[01:03:23] the other theory on this is that uh there's a game

[01:03:26] theory to it as well where if you have counterparts that are

[01:03:30] um engaged in extremely unfair trade maybe

[01:03:34] maybe you have to threaten tariffs as a way to get them to open up

[01:03:38] if you're if you're always saying we're never going to do anything you

[01:03:42] know you you will end up with a very subpar uh

[01:03:45] kind of a free trade world so this is this where even if in theory

[01:03:49] we believe in free trade I never want free trade treaties negotiated

[01:03:53] by people who are ideological free Traders because

[01:03:56] they will always think they don't need to negotiate anything and then

[01:04:00] there's so many other points I can let me make one one one last point on this um

[01:04:05] is uh if you did 60% across

[01:04:08] the board tariffs on China

[01:04:12] um it probably would

[01:04:16] be very very bad for Chinese

[01:04:20] companies and China it would only be mildly

[01:04:24] bad for us consumers because

[01:04:28] an awful lot of stuff would get shifted away from China and

[01:04:32] because trade is not we always model it is between two countries well the

[01:04:35] thing people say to scare people is you do you want to be

[01:04:39] yeah sorry it's and I think there's a lot of stuff that doesn't get shifted back to the

[01:04:42] US I I don't believe that's what happens so you know the iPhone

[01:04:46] you can't build those economically in the US so it doesn't get shifted from

[01:04:50] China to the US if you put 60% tariffs on iPhones

[01:04:54] um and it costs twice as much to make them the us then

[01:04:57] they just cost more but what what I think will happen is you

[01:05:01] you shift the iPhones to Vietnam or

[01:05:05] India or places like that and maybe maybe our

[01:05:08] def trade deficit doesn't go down but we at least aren't

[01:05:12] helping our geopolitical rival Vietnam

[01:05:15] is an evil communist country but it's not bent on world domination

[01:05:20] so um so if you if you shift manufacturing

[01:05:24] from China to Viet Vietnam that hurts China

[01:05:28] it is maybe mildly negative for American

[01:05:31] consumers it's really good for Vietnam but uh but in this

[01:05:35] geopolitical calculus that seems seems very much in the American

[01:05:39] interest Trump has promised not just to close

[01:05:42] the border which I think everyone can now acknowledge after

[01:05:46] the election has become extremely chaotic and dangerous

[01:05:50] but he's promised to deport something like 11 million people

[01:05:54] do you think that's actually going to

[01:05:59] happen I I don't think I I

[01:06:02] I don't I don't think they're literally going to do that

[01:06:06] uh uh and then you know at at the same

[01:06:10] time there there is some there's some big

[01:06:14] big way these these things you know need to be need to be

[01:06:17] rethought a lot and uh like trade um

[01:06:21] you know there there there's a there's a theory of immigration

[01:06:25] where it somehow grows the GDP you it's

[01:06:29] it's grown the economy um and

[01:06:32] and I always think um one of the differences in Immigration debates

[01:06:36] between Europe and the US is in Europe

[01:06:40] immigration is is mainly a cultural issue

[01:06:44] and you end up with a lot of immigrants who

[01:06:47] maybe don't share um European cultural values and

[01:06:51] then Europe's societies are bad at culturally assimilating

[01:06:55] these people and there sort of our a set of cultural

[01:06:58] challenges with uh with immigration I think

[01:07:02] the US is still pretty good at assimilating

[01:07:06] people culturally even with a lot of the ways our public schools and

[01:07:09] other institutions aren't working as well as they used to um

[01:07:13] but I think the challenges with immigration are more of a

[01:07:17] of an economic nature in the US and uh

[01:07:21] and that uh even though there are ways that um

[01:07:24] immigrants can grow the pie it also has these effects

[01:07:28] of um of uh creating incredible

[01:07:32] um incredible SKS incredible winner loser

[01:07:35] Dynamics in the US uh the

[01:07:39] I know the and I go through all these different V variations of

[01:07:42] it you know I I myself am an immigrant you know my my parents uh

[01:07:46] I was born in Germany we immigrated to the US and

[01:07:50] in 1968 sort of the craziest year

[01:07:53] ever people thought my parents were out mind leave Germany and come to the US

[01:07:57] the 1968 year the country was self-destructing and

[01:08:01] uh I'm you know very fortunate they did and so

[01:08:05] I can't be sort of a categorical anti-immigrant person

[01:08:09] uh or at least it be sort of weird pulling the ladder up behind

[01:08:12] me type of dynamic but at the same time I

[01:08:16] think um there one one should somehow

[01:08:20] be able to talk about all the ways that it creates these incredible

[01:08:25] econom SKS and distortions and uh the

[01:08:28] um I don't know I'll just go down one particular vertical that I think

[01:08:32] uh is pretty important which is um Henry

[01:08:36] George is this late 19th century Economist

[01:08:40] uh who was um he was considered quasi socialist in

[01:08:43] the late 19th century he's considered semi- libertarian in the early 21st

[01:08:47] century which maybe tells you something about how our society changed

[01:08:50] but the uh the basic georgist Obsession was real

[01:08:54] estate and it was if you weren't really careful you would

[01:08:58] get runaway real estate prices and the people

[01:09:01] who owned the real estate would make all the gains in a society

[01:09:06] because there's something extremely inelastic about real estate

[01:09:09] especially if you have strict zoning laws or things like this

[01:09:14] um um um uh

[01:09:17] the dynamic ends up being that uh you add 10%

[01:09:21] to the population in a city and maybe the house prices

[01:09:25] go up 50% and um and maybe people's

[01:09:28] salaries go up but they don't go up by 50%

[01:09:32] and so uh the GDP grows but it's a giant wind

[01:09:36] windfall to the Boomer homeowners and to the

[01:09:39] landlords and it's um it's a massive hit

[01:09:43] to the lower middle class and to young people who can never get

[01:09:46] on the housing ladder and um and there's sort of a way

[01:09:50] that I I model what's happened in the US

[01:09:54] in Britain Canada a lot of the anglosphere

[01:09:58] countries is a georgist real estate

[01:10:02] catastrophe where uh where basically

[01:10:06] uh and you know there's sort of ways I can describe this in Los Angeles where we

[01:10:10] live you know but all sorts of places where

[01:10:14] uh yeah the real estate prices the rents have gone up

[01:10:18] more and more if we talk about the inflation problem in this last was inflation

[01:10:21] and immigration but the uh you know and there's a way you could

[01:10:25] talk about in inflation in terms of you know the prices

[01:10:29] of eggs or groceries um but you know that's not

[01:10:33] that big a cost item even for lower middle class people

[01:10:36] the really big cost item is the rent and I think

[01:10:40] um I think in some ways uh Trump and JD

[01:10:44] Vance did did manage to shift the conversation

[01:10:48] a little bit to this real estate problem and again I don't want to you know blame

[01:10:52] it all on immigration but if you yeah if you just

[01:10:56] you know add more people m to the mix and you're not allowed

[01:10:59] to build new houses because of zoning laws where it's too

[01:11:03] expensive or it's too regulated and restricted then um

[01:11:06] then the prices go up a lot and it's this incredible wealth

[01:11:10] transfer from The Young and the lower middle

[01:11:14] class to the upper middle class and the landlords and the

[01:11:17] old and there are reasons you might not want to do that there are a lot

[01:11:21] of reasons you might not want to do it so that's that's sort of a very

[01:11:25] no invidious distinctions involved this is just sort of a basic

[01:11:29] econ one point that uh we can't even make you know

[01:11:33] I think most Americans though when they're thinking about the border and immigration

[01:11:37] are thinking about you know particular stories

[01:11:40] that were you know I think rightly made a big deal

[01:11:44] in this campaign they're thinking about criminals and drug cartels

[01:11:47] and sex trafficking and things like that they are not thinking

[01:11:51] I don't think we should Deport the Mexican

[01:11:55] you know grandmother living in West

[01:11:59] Hollywood or whatever and is that what we're going to see um

[01:12:02] well I I I would say that the the incredibly

[01:12:06] open border has put an

[01:12:10] incredible stress on the social Fabric

[01:12:13] in a lot of ways um and yeah there's definitely the fental

[01:12:17] crisis there are you know the Narco

[01:12:21] drug gangs uh you know there

[01:12:25] all these sort of crazy extreme stories that shouldn't

[01:12:28] happen at all and that tell you tells you something's very off

[01:12:32] but then I think there's also you know there's also a general version

[01:12:36] where you know I don't even know what the numbers are but you have a Los Angeles

[01:12:40] public high school system in which you have to teach in 30 different languages

[01:12:44] or something like that and in which you know

[01:12:48] um the public schools aren't working and um and then

[01:12:52] and then the uh you know the amount people people

[01:12:56] have to spend on on rent in these places is so

[01:13:00] much higher than it was 30 40 50 years ago

[01:13:04] as a percent of income and uh and that's you know that's a

[01:13:07] stress on immigrants it's a uh it's a stress on

[01:13:11] the people they're competing with directly this this is a sense in which

[01:13:15] you know if if you say that uh the

[01:13:18] immigrants you know let's say I don't know lower middle

[01:13:22] class Mexican immigrants are competing with lower middle class

[01:13:26] Mexican people in La then as an economic

[01:13:29] matter those are the people who should be the most Anti it if we

[01:13:33] go with identity politics they should say well you know we want more Mexicans

[01:13:37] but if if you actually think of it in econ one terms

[01:13:41] um no maybe you don't want more people competing for your

[01:13:45] um you know two-bedroom apartment and driving up the rent even more

[01:13:48] or even more people crowding in and um you know um

[01:13:52] paying money uh paying money to the landlord you know if

[01:13:55] you're a Bangladeshi Uber driver in New York City

[01:13:59] do you want a lot more bangladeshis this is always you know this is always the

[01:14:03] point I make about cloning where we can have all sorts of ethical

[01:14:07] debates about cloning but the econ one intuition is

[01:14:10] if we came along with 100 clones of Barry Weiss with competing

[01:14:15] talk shows you know you might might say well I

[01:14:18] I can't you know we can debate the ethics of this but we should be talking

[01:14:22] about the economics and you would be right say I'm kind of nervous

[01:14:26] about the economics band cloning um Trump I'm just I'm

[01:14:29] just saying we should we should at least be able to talk about the economics let's talk about education

[01:14:33] an issue you care a lot about Trump has promised to get rid of the Department of

[01:14:37] Education saying it's unnecessary and effective and a tool of the W culture

[01:14:41] wars and he's also threatened to cut funding for higher education

[01:14:45] and I guess I want to ask you a first principal's question which is

[01:14:49] you know should taxpayer dollars go to support private

[01:14:52] universities like Harvard and do you think that getting rid of the

[01:14:56] Department of Education would be a good thing

[01:15:00] yes it would be a good thing I I think you have to pick the battles of

[01:15:04] what you can do uh and where you can you

[01:15:07] can change things uh I think I think there

[01:15:11] are I don't know there are there are a lot of indirect ways

[01:15:15] you can you can shift things there is um the NIH

[01:15:19] gives research grants a lot of those go to university

[01:15:22] scientists and then there is a overhead budget

[01:15:26] which is typically something like 40% if you get a million dollar

[01:15:30] Grant maybe 40% of that or like 66%

[01:15:34] overcharge gets charged by the university in in overhead

[01:15:38] I believe that number can be arbitrarily reset and you can

[01:15:42] you can reset that as a much much lower number and

[01:15:46] uh it seems to me and so a nuanced argument would be I want

[01:15:49] more money to go to the scientists and I want less money to

[01:15:53] go to the woke administ rtion and diversity and what

[01:15:56] we know is this bloated um you know diversity machine

[01:16:01] overhead and um and you know we won't defund

[01:16:05] the universities simply but we're going to we're going to change

[01:16:08] the overhead expensing and I I believe that number

[01:16:12] can be unilaterally zeroed out by executive order

[01:16:16] or Changed by executive order and uh so I

[01:16:19] think there are there are you know I think the Department of Education is one of these weird

[01:16:23] departments where very little can be done and very little changed

[01:16:27] but there are things like that that can be done that are quite dramatic

[01:16:30] there's obviously you know a student debt crisis that's

[01:16:35] completely out of control it was you know 300 billion in student

[01:16:39] debt in 2000 it's it's now um

[01:16:43] approaching $2 trillion and then and there sort

[01:16:46] of is a way that it's crept up on people that uh is sort

[01:16:50] of subtle I was looking at this the other day so if you look at it by cohort

[01:16:54] if you graduated from college in 1997

[01:16:58] um 12 years later 2009

[01:17:02] you had um you paid off most of your student debt it took

[01:17:05] you a long time so probably the student debt meant you were slower to start a

[01:17:09] family to buy a house so you know it sort of probably in some ways

[01:17:12] had this deleterious effect on your career but there was some way

[01:17:16] that you took on all this debt and you could gradually get out of the hole

[01:17:20] and then gradually the debt grew faster

[01:17:24] than the value of the college degree grew economically and

[01:17:27] by 2009 the graduates of 2009 are

[01:17:31] the first cohort where the median student

[01:17:35] with debt in 2009 when you look at them 12 years later

[01:17:39] in 2021 the debts higher and and

[01:17:42] which means that uh you know that you can't even keep up with the interest payments

[01:17:46] on the student debt it's so big and the value of

[01:17:50] your college degree for the most part is so low you get an English

[01:17:53] PhD you end up with a a barista at Starbucks or some something like this

[01:17:57] and you know there obviously some exceptions like computer science but uh

[01:18:01] most most degrees had so little value the debt was so big

[01:18:05] but then it it it takes 12 years to realize

[01:18:08] that it's not working like it used to because for for a long time

[01:18:12] the colleges can just say well you know it eventually pays off

[01:18:16] it takes a while and maybe that's true but if it's no longer

[01:18:19] true um man are you in a deep hole by the time you realize it so

[01:18:23] there's something that's that's very very off

[01:18:27] with it you know I

[01:18:30] I'm I'm actually somewhat sympathetic to the

[01:18:35] the Biden policy that you know may maybe on some level

[01:18:38] you need to just forgive the student debt because people will never be able to pay

[01:18:42] it off and we need to have some realistic level

[01:18:45] setting um I don't think it they should be bailed out

[01:18:49] by the taxpayers and I think you know some of it should be should

[01:18:52] be um this some it has to be hit to the bond holders

[01:18:56] the debt and some of it has to be hit to uh the colleges mhm

[01:19:00] and uh and probably a lot of college if if if the colleges

[01:19:04] were even partially liable for all these unpaid debts

[01:19:08] most of them would be out of business and so there's yeah there's

[01:19:12] there's something so there are sort of a number of these things that

[01:19:15] you know they're they're coming to a head regardless I don't think Trump needs

[01:19:19] to particularly do anything let me give you let me give it's going to implode on its own

[01:19:23] it is it's an exponential growing uh student

[01:19:26] debt problem it's an exponentially growing debt problem generally

[01:19:30] and uh you know there's we had for many years you

[01:19:34] could kick the can down the road but eventually end up with a pile of

[01:19:37] cans and no Road and that's sort of where we are with the student death thing or

[01:19:41] or another you know I think this was a very strange 2024

[01:19:45] election where uh there were all these big issues

[01:19:48] that I think were were not being discussed so one

[01:19:52] one other this is you know this is what speculate

[01:19:55] was one of the really big issues um even bigger

[01:19:59] than just the student debt problem is maybe the bankruptcy

[01:20:03] of a number of blue States and blue cities

[01:20:06] Illinois Chicago probably the tri-state

[01:20:10] area New York City maybe even San Francisco

[01:20:14] maybe Los Angeles and um

[01:20:18] and what we did in 2020

[01:20:21] was we used CO as a cover to bail all these places out then 2021

[01:20:26] they spent even more money in this runaway Biden spending and

[01:20:30] part of it was was um a way to bail out

[01:20:33] all these failed blue cities and blue States

[01:20:37] and uh we should not be throwing good money after bad

[01:20:41] and all that Trump trump doesn't need to do something heroic like shutting

[01:20:45] down the Department of Education or getting Congress to

[01:20:49] reduce Appropriations all he has to do for

[01:20:53] the blue cities and blue states to blow up is sit on his hands

[01:20:57] and do nothing there was you know there was a 1970s history

[01:21:01] in the Ford Administration where New York City almost went

[01:21:04] broke and Ford sat on his hands and it was the

[01:21:08] most popular thing Ford was down 30 points he

[01:21:12] came back to almost winning re-election in 1976

[01:21:16] and one of the main it was it was very popular

[01:21:19] not to bail out New York City because people know we don't want to throw you know

[01:21:24] good money after bad and uh and and and

[01:21:27] and so I think I think there are you know this this

[01:21:31] is sort of if if you if you look at the possibilities of changing

[01:21:35] the system there's a way the inertia seems

[01:21:38] so high that if it's if we have to you know get rid of the Department of Education I don't think that will

[01:21:42] ever happen and then I think the Democrats have nothing to worry about

[01:21:45] because Trump won't really do anything but if actually for

[01:21:49] the system to continue you need to get crazy new spending

[01:21:53] approved and all the Trump has to do is not approve the new spending

[01:21:57] that's where I think you're going to be able to force radical change radical

[01:22:00] change in California in New York in Illinois

[01:22:04] where um you know these places have to reform themselves or go

[01:22:08] bankrupt I want to talk a little bit about JD Vance whose name has come up a

[01:22:12] few times um you gave $15

[01:22:15] million to help him get elected in the 2022 midterms it might

[01:22:19] be the best $15 million arguably that you've ever spent but you'll tell me

[01:22:23] and I think you introd uced Trump to JD Vance in 2021 at Mar

[01:22:27] Lago now at this time JD Vance was singing a very different

[01:22:31] tune he had called Trump reprehensible he had talked about him as being America's

[01:22:35] Hitler obviously we've come a long way uh in

[01:22:38] in those three years um and I guess I want to ask you know

[01:22:42] what did you see in him that made you bet that made you bet so big on

[01:22:46] him um well you know um I I

[01:22:49] first met him in 2011 when uh

[01:22:53] had a you know met a group of people at uh Yale

[01:22:57] law school and did a small lunch with the federal Society group there and

[01:23:00] uh you know he worked for one of my Venture funds and

[01:23:05] became friends over over the years and and uh he was

[01:23:09] I don't know just a very thoughtful person

[01:23:13] um who thought very deeply about about a lot of these

[01:23:17] these these issues and uh I'm probably

[01:23:21] I don't know I'm probably always a sucker for smart thoughtful people you know but

[01:23:25] but in 2011 when you meet a young JD Vance were you thinking future president

[01:23:29] of the United States I don't I don't know no I I don't think but

[01:23:33] I no I I thought I thought he was

[01:23:37] he made a great first impression and then uh and then you know

[01:23:41] um yeah we sort of worked together for

[01:23:44] a number of years and uh and um you know I got to know him

[01:23:48] better over time um I do I do

[01:23:52] think you know the the probably all these different ways

[01:23:56] that JD would do a better job articulating his

[01:24:00] his shift since since um 2016 and I think I

[01:24:04] think you know I don't think he was saying things like that in 2018

[01:24:08] or 2019 I think it was it was more sort of in the

[01:24:12] 2016 uh around the time when he wrote the hillbilly LG

[01:24:16] book and and he was sort of you

[01:24:19] know in some ways became

[01:24:25] um the way to explain Trump

[01:24:29] to you know liberals liberal

[01:24:32] Elites and and there was sort

[01:24:36] of a part of that that I think

[01:24:40] felt um felt very good to JD

[01:24:44] and then um and then there was some part

[01:24:48] where at some point he felt like they weren't really interested in

[01:24:52] anything he had to say and um and maybe

[01:24:56] maybe it was just sort of like a prop where um you know

[01:24:59] if we if we bought his book we understand

[01:25:03] we don't need to read it we don't need to actually think about anything in it but if we've

[01:25:07] if we've bought his book um we've understood this as

[01:25:11] as as as as well as we need to and

[01:25:14] so so I think I think I think the yeah I think

[01:25:18] the personal version on on the

[01:25:22] on the JD Van Story was on some level

[01:25:26] in 2016 um he believed there was a way

[01:25:30] to convince liberals to figure out you know a

[01:25:33] way to solve some of these deep

[01:25:37] problems immigration economics

[01:25:41] you know the crisis of the Midwest and

[01:25:45] um and then at some point um he thought they weren't really

[01:25:49] interested in solving them at all and that maybe maybe

[01:25:52] Trump somewhat more aders Arial approach was actually

[01:25:56] more correct than he had first thought one of the shifts that we're seeing

[01:26:00] inside the Republican party is not just on sort of

[01:26:03] um doctrinaire free trade um but

[01:26:07] is on foreign policy and there's a shift I would say from

[01:26:11] let's call it I don't know what to call it like the the neocon worldview

[01:26:14] that typified the bush years to something

[01:26:18] that I don't think is quite isolationist but is different right you have someone

[01:26:22] like JD Vance saying I got to be honest with you I don't really care

[01:26:25] what happens to Ukraine and I wonder

[01:26:29] how you're making sense of that shift because you know at the all-in

[01:26:32] summit a few months ago and you referenced it already in this conversation you said

[01:26:36] we're sleepwalking into Armageddon and from my

[01:26:40] perspective you know when I hear different versions

[01:26:44] of um America's trying to do too much America should not

[01:26:47] be the world's policemen America needs to kind of pull back from the world

[01:26:51] Focus inward my visceral reaction ction is

[01:26:55] well then someone's going to fill that vacuum and it

[01:26:58] worries me um and I don't think that makes me some kind of neocon War

[01:27:02] Monger to be concerned about that and I I worry that there's a

[01:27:05] kind of caricature of a debate happening right now

[01:27:09] where anyone that feels concerned about the decline

[01:27:13] of American power or defensive of American

[01:27:17] muscularity gets easily dunked on because it's not the

[01:27:20] cool thing right now to say um on the right yes I

[01:27:24] I would love for you to make sense of where you think the

[01:27:28] right is Shifting um and how you

[01:27:31] think this Administration is going to conduct foreign

[01:27:35] policy well I I do think Pro probably a lot of

[01:27:38] these things are you know

[01:27:42] more subtle and you know more nuanced

[01:27:46] and we have to it's probably best to always talk about

[01:27:50] particular countries and particular situations

[01:27:54] uh I don't exactly know what you're supposed to do

[01:27:58] about the Ukraine right now I I'm not sure

[01:28:02] that um the Trump Administration has a strongly set

[01:28:05] policy on that at all uh there's definitely a historical

[01:28:10] thing where one one could say that the um

[01:28:14] the Relentless NATO expansion might not have been a good idea

[01:28:18] and there were ways that uh you know

[01:28:22] um I don't know we don't want the Russians to have troops

[01:28:26] in Cuba or Mexico and maybe if NATO has troops in the

[01:28:30] Ukraine you know should we have

[01:28:33] thought a little bit about how far we

[01:28:37] how far we uh we pushed that that envelope

[01:28:41] and um and then at the same time you know there's there's a part of

[01:28:45] it where we are where we are in 2024

[01:28:49] and uh you probably can't you know simply

[01:28:53] Retreat from the Ukraine um without it just

[01:28:56] becoming a route and I I don't think Trump uh president

[01:29:00] Trump wants a repeat of what happened with Biden and Afghanistan

[01:29:04] you know I think I I don't know you know in the in the Middle East

[01:29:08] context I I I always think that there's an isolationist

[01:29:12] approach there is an idealistic

[01:29:16] you know almost utopian neocon approach as was

[01:29:19] articulated by Bush 43 in a second inaugural address

[01:29:23] in 200 5 which was I mean it was just going to transform

[01:29:27] the whole world in a in a way that was

[01:29:32] Fantastical and you know just you could tell was

[01:29:36] not going to end the way it was advertised and then there's again sort of

[01:29:39] this in between Messi dealing with the reality the Middle East approach

[01:29:43] and uh I don't know I I I don't I don't think

[01:29:47] the US and Israel are

[01:29:51] you know perfectly in sync but but I

[01:29:54] I do think that uh if we simply deferred

[01:29:58] to Israel and um on things

[01:30:02] related to the Middle East we'd have a far serer policy

[01:30:06] we'd have a far more realistic policy and the Israel

[01:30:10] you know in a way the neocons were pro-israel the Israelis

[01:30:13] didn't trust the neocons because Israel is a small country it needs to

[01:30:17] be realistic and the neocons were these crazy

[01:30:21] idealists and so the Israeli View if I

[01:30:25] it's complicated thought about this so much the way I would the way the way I would summarize

[01:30:28] the Israeli view is you know what do you think about Syria um they're no

[01:30:32] good Rebels everybody in Syria is bad you know we don't like

[01:30:36] Assad we don't like the Isis people you know

[01:30:40] you know maybe you can be somewhat involved you don't want to be that involved in Syria

[01:30:44] um you know the Saudis yeah it's a feudal monarchy

[01:30:47] it's better than the Alternatives and um

[01:30:51] and uh and the the problem the one problem

[01:30:55] is Iran because you know if they get nuclear weapons

[01:30:59] you know it changes the playing field in the whole region and so

[01:31:03] you know what when I first met Netanyahu in January 2009

[01:31:06] one month before he came back as prime minister the only thing he wanted

[01:31:10] to talk about was Iran and that was you know and that's that's the

[01:31:13] sense in which I think the

[01:31:17] Trump foreign policy with the Middle East will be

[01:31:21] pretty closely in sync with Israel where you will at least be focused

[01:31:25] on the same problem the same question and and you know the

[01:31:28] the reason we don't want Iran to get nuclear weapons you know you know

[01:31:32] maybe it's a crazy theocracy and it will use them but

[01:31:36] even if Iran doesn't use them just having them will somehow

[01:31:40] change the whole playing field I think one of the international things a

[01:31:44] president was supposed to do Post 1945 was stop

[01:31:47] nuclear proliferation because if too many countries get nuclear weapons

[01:31:52] that's one of the ways we sleep walk to arm again because eventually something if you

[01:31:55] have 100 countries with nuclear weapons I don't think that's a stable Game

[01:31:59] Theory equilibrium of of the world and

[01:32:02] you know one of the lessons I take of the ear of the mid 20th

[01:32:06] century was every time a country got a nuclear weapon we got a regional

[01:32:10] War the Soviet Union gets the bomb in 1949

[01:32:13] the Korean war starts in 1950 because when the Soviet

[01:32:17] Union backs North Korea we can't bomb Russia

[01:32:21] and then they can back North Korea with impunity and we get a massive

[01:32:25] massive Regional War um and that's in a way the price

[01:32:29] for being asleep of the switch and letting the Soviets get the bomb

[01:32:33] 1964 communist China gets the bomb Vietnam War

[01:32:37] explodes in 1965 and again China can back

[01:32:41] North Vietnam with impunity we can't reciprocate

[01:32:44] and and then the and then the way I understand you know

[01:32:48] why would an Iranian nuclear bomb be a catastrophe

[01:32:53] because you know the degree to which Iran can

[01:32:56] support this you know um plethora

[01:33:00] of Bad actors the houth the Hamas people and Hezbollah

[01:33:04] and and on and on uh throughout the Middle East

[01:33:08] you could not retaliate against Iran if

[01:33:11] if there are nuclear power you can't retaliate against Iran and uh

[01:33:15] and then the degree to which they will support all the whole Middle East

[01:33:18] will explode and so we don't have

[01:33:22] to we don't have to go to the sort of crazy theocracy

[01:33:26] that's gonna that said they'd use the bomb and would use it it's it's I think it's

[01:33:30] just it's it's just the nature of it and and I think there's a way that

[01:33:34] Israel understood this and there's a way the neocons

[01:33:38] you know lost the forest for the trees like you know there

[01:33:41] there were ways the Israelis and the Saudis probably had misgivings

[01:33:45] about the Iraq War because you know Iraq was the country that's blocking

[01:33:49] Iran and if you weaken Iraq aren't you strengthening

[01:33:53] Iran and in the end and in some sense that's what happened

[01:33:56] in some sense that's what happened over 20 years

[01:34:00] Trump over the past 48 Hours has made a number of appointments on this score

[01:34:03] it looks like Marco Rubio is going to be the Secretary of State

[01:34:07] Michael Walls is going to be a national security adviser Alise stonic

[01:34:11] is going to the UN that's a pretty hawkish

[01:34:16] group I I think they're all pretty hawkish on China

[01:34:20] and and I think that is probably

[01:34:24] you know that's probably the other the other um

[01:34:27] the other I don't know

[01:34:32] place where you know I don't want to say things are coming to aead but where

[01:34:36] um we we have to

[01:34:40] really you know F find

[01:34:43] a find a better balance than we've been than we found in

[01:34:47] in the past in the past few few few decades and

[01:34:51] uh uh I think

[01:34:56] I think um I

[01:34:59] believe all of them I I wouldn't say

[01:35:03] that they will prioritize China at the expense of everything else but I

[01:35:07] think they will they will prioritize

[01:35:11] China um you know more more than the Biden

[01:35:15] Administration and um more than the Europeans

[01:35:20] would one last question and then I want to talk about sort of the future of the

[01:35:23] and populism there's a sort of grotesque thing happening

[01:35:27] in certain precincts of the right where I guess

[01:35:31] the way to describe it would be sort of like a Revival of Patrick

[01:35:34] Buchanan's view of things like World War II

[01:35:38] that felt pretty settled you know Hitler's the villain church will save the

[01:35:42] West um I'm sure you've noticed some of this and I

[01:35:45] wonder where that historical revisionism

[01:35:49] is coming from um and why you think it's so seductive

[01:35:53] to people in this

[01:35:57] moment man you know these things are these things are

[01:36:01] always difficult to score

[01:36:07] culturally but I I'm you know I'm tempted to say

[01:36:11] that the you know I mean you never

[01:36:15] want to defend the Nazis and you never want to defend Hitler

[01:36:19] and it's just there are probably some

[01:36:23] Fringe people who say they're on the right that do this but isn't this

[01:36:27] 90% a left-wing scop

[01:36:31] of sorts where it's you know it is

[01:36:35] uh I don't know you know first rule of high school debate

[01:36:39] is whoever you know brings up Hitler Los right

[01:36:42] and you know this was in a way what but a lot of people on the right are bringing up Hitler on their

[01:36:47] own you don't see it I I don't

[01:36:51] I don't see people doing it in posit way or you

[01:36:54] know it's it's here's how I would

[01:36:58] put it let me let me you have to yeah

[01:37:01] i' want you to give me like the actual quotes where okay let me phrase it

[01:37:05] another way I I don't and I don't think even Buchanan would would would

[01:37:09] do this I I I challenge you to come up with a even a Buchanan

[01:37:12] quote and he wrote a lot over decades where

[01:37:16] let let me phrase in another way there's a strain

[01:37:20] on the right right now to go back to what you said about how make

[01:37:23] America great again was sort of the ultimate I've never heard that that's

[01:37:27] really insightful like the ultimate pessimistic slogan

[01:37:31] I think there is a group on the right that feels

[01:37:35] so let's be generous alienated

[01:37:39] enraged um frustrated at the direction of the country

[01:37:43] that they've given into a kind of nihilistic

[01:37:47] we deserve for everything to fail we deserve for everything to burn

[01:37:50] it down which is I I I I don't think I don't think

[01:37:54] that's that's correct and certainly and

[01:37:58] certainly there's a way that's all that can be is like a

[01:38:01] negative self-fulfilling New Age bad prophecy

[01:38:05] where if you know if you if you're a white supremacist who thinks

[01:38:09] that um the white people are all going to be losers

[01:38:13] um I don't know if you're correct but what I suspect you

[01:38:17] personally will do is you will eat a lot of donuts and move into a trailer

[01:38:21] and um and so it it's a self fulfilling negative prophecy about

[01:38:24] what will happen in your life um and and so yes I

[01:38:28] I don't I don't believe in doing anything like that at

[01:38:32] all um I I think there are there are

[01:38:35] ways that the US is overstretched there are

[01:38:39] ways that uh you know we have to

[01:38:42] I'm not sure prioritize but there there are some kind of

[01:38:46] there's some kind of constraints there's some kind of way in which we don't have

[01:38:50] the the money there's no money left and and

[01:38:54] there is you know the budget deficits there there things like this there are

[01:38:58] there are certain types of constraints if I had to do

[01:39:02] the the history uh the 20th century history

[01:39:06] the um I don't think this is revisionist but the way I would

[01:39:10] tell the history of the 20th century is that we had two

[01:39:13] world wars and um and the thing that's extremely

[01:39:17] confusing about the two World Wars is that they teach diametrically

[01:39:21] opposite lessons and the lesson of World War

[01:39:25] II is you do not

[01:39:29] appease um you do not appease dictators and if you

[01:39:33] give an inch they will take a mile and you let you know Hitler take

[01:39:36] the sedan land and then it was all of Czechoslovakia and then you know it was

[01:39:40] Austria and and then

[01:39:44] it it just went on and on and on and uh and then

[01:39:48] but but World War I um teaches the

[01:39:51] opposite lesson which is you don't want to

[01:39:55] have a network of secret alliances

[01:39:59] entangling alliances with hair trigger mobilization

[01:40:03] and escalation schedules where um

[01:40:07] you know you have this Tinder Box in Saro where the assassination

[01:40:11] of the arch Duke Ferdinand somehow triggers

[01:40:15] you know this this four-year congration that destroys

[01:40:19] Europe and um and

[01:40:22] and that you in a way you know the place where appeasement

[01:40:27] came from in the 1930s and you in part it was because it

[01:40:30] felt like there was no money the depression you know everybody was bankrupt you

[01:40:34] couldn't spend money on the military you couldn't spend money on anything but um

[01:40:37] but part of it was was okay this is the way we course correct for World War

[01:40:41] I we're not going to have this hair trigger escalation

[01:40:45] and and so it and then the the

[01:40:49] difficult Paradox is if we're going to avoid World War III

[01:40:54] you know I think you somehow have to learn the lessons of both Wars

[01:40:57] and um and so somehow you can't have

[01:41:01] you know you can't have excessive appeasement and you

[01:41:05] also can't go sleepwalking into Armageddon and they're

[01:41:08] they're in a way opposite lessons and um

[01:41:12] and then and then perhaps you know I I won't say

[01:41:16] that you should be 100% World War I and 0% World War II

[01:41:19] but my you know contrarian intuition where I'd be maybe

[01:41:23] 60 70% focused on World War I and 30 or 40%

[01:41:27] on World War II is I think we always have a recency bias

[01:41:31] we're always fighting the last war and um the

[01:41:35] last World War was World War II and so that's the one

[01:41:38] we're obsessed with drawing the lessons from and um

[01:41:42] and and my contrarian intuition is that if we have a

[01:41:46] World War it'll be more like World War I it'll look

[01:41:50] like what's been happening the last few years where it says gradually escalating

[01:41:54] configration but it will it will happen you know it'll happen overnight

[01:41:58] it it will it will not be it will you know World War

[01:42:01] II people could see coming for a long time World War I had

[01:42:05] this you know this this this crazy feel you know the other thing that's

[01:42:08] more like World War I than World War II is

[01:42:12] um World War I the pre-World War I World

[01:42:16] was one that was incredibly connected through globalization

[01:42:20] through trade and finance one of the books that I think is always a super

[01:42:23] interesting one to read was 1910 Norman Angel

[01:42:27] um wrote this book the great illusion what was the great illusion it

[01:42:31] was this bestseller sold books around the world

[01:42:34] in all the countries that would eventually fight World War I what was the thesis the

[01:42:38] thesis the great illusion was that the great illusion was that there could

[01:42:41] be a World War and there could not be

[01:42:45] a World War because everybody would lose and

[01:42:48] um and it it would make as much sense according to Norman Angel for

[01:42:52] the UK to go to war with

[01:42:56] Germany as it would make sense for London

[01:42:59] to invade um the county of Hertford

[01:43:04] Hertfordshire the adjacent County to London because

[01:43:07] um you know the stock market in London would go down more than

[01:43:11] the value of any property could grab in Hertfordshire in a world that was

[01:43:14] connected through finance and trade and there

[01:43:18] was that felt very Global like it was in 1913

[01:43:23] um it was obviously insane to have um a World War

[01:43:26] and then it nevertheless happened and there was you know there was

[01:43:30] and then I think there's a way that the globalization

[01:43:34] regime was deeply unhealthy deeply unstable

[01:43:37] and th those are the kinds of lessons you know we should yes so

[01:43:41] I I don't know I definitely think there are you know

[01:43:44] we don't want to be Chamberlain you don't want to sort of be um

[01:43:49] doing those mistakes from the 1930s at all

[01:43:52] uh I also think it's it's it's worth uh thinking very hard

[01:43:56] about where was where was Norman Angel wrong and

[01:44:00] you know why why why did the great illusion

[01:44:04] turn out not to be a great illusion at all

[01:44:07] populism is in Vogue right now and populism

[01:44:11] is something that always makes me wary because populism

[01:44:15] leads to scapegoating and scapegoating leads to blaming minority

[01:44:19] groups and often Jews and I see

[01:44:23] this sentiment um and you see it playing out on Twitter all the time people love

[01:44:26] this phrase a lot of people on the right Vox popul Vox day voice

[01:44:30] of the people is the voice of God and I can't think of a wronger

[01:44:34] thing that has been said um I don't think the voice of the people are

[01:44:37] the voice of God um yes and I

[01:44:41] wonder I wonder if you know you're someone who

[01:44:45] looks back to history obviously how do you contain

[01:44:49] populace energies and harness them in a productive way

[01:44:53] away without them running rough shod

[01:44:57] over any number of minority groups well

[01:45:00] um Let me let me start in a slightly

[01:45:04] uh different way and this is plagiarizing sort of an idea that Eric

[01:45:08] Weinstein likes to popularize a lot but it's uh this thing called a Russell

[01:45:11] conjugate which is um two words that

[01:45:15] are um synonyms but

[01:45:19] are emotional antonyms okay and so

[01:45:23] a thinkink and a whistleblower maybe it's

[01:45:26] the same thing but a whistleblower is a good person and a thinkink is a bad person

[01:45:30] so they're emotional antonyms even though they're kind of s they're

[01:45:34] kind of the same thing if you think about it and um

[01:45:37] I I would submit that a Russell conjugate

[01:45:41] of sorts is populism and

[01:45:45] democracy and um democ democracy is

[01:45:48] good populism is bad um and it's democracy when

[01:45:52] people vote the right way and it's populism when they vote the

[01:45:56] wrong way and what that what that tells

[01:45:59] us is that uh there's probably a lot

[01:46:03] in these in these Concepts that needs to be

[01:46:07] to be really really unpacked and um

[01:46:11] and so yeah I uh you

[01:46:16] know I you know I'm

[01:46:20] I I share your concerns about popul ISM

[01:46:24] um I also have concerns about democracy for the

[01:46:27] exact same reason you know it's it's uh it if

[01:46:31] everyone just gets to vote on everything that's just

[01:46:34] rampant majoritarianism and there obviously are all

[01:46:38] sorts of ways that Minority Rights get

[01:46:42] oppressed or you know the the libertarian version is that wealthy people

[01:46:45] probably just have their property voted away from them so you know respect property rights

[01:46:49] minorities get trampled on so there are all sorts of ways in

[01:46:53] which um you know we're we're not supposed to have rampant

[01:46:57] majoritarianism and then the the kinds of you know the

[01:47:00] kinds of checks on that you know it was

[01:47:04] republicanism is supposed to be a check on Democracy where you

[01:47:07] don't the people don't vote on things directly they vote on them indirectly

[01:47:11] and you elect representatives and then the Constitution is supposed to be a

[01:47:15] check on republicanism where you know even the legislature can't just do whatever

[01:47:18] it wants and it has to still be compatible with the Constitution

[01:47:22] and uh and then that's that's kind of

[01:47:26] um that's kind of the the intuition

[01:47:30] I would have about our society now I um

[01:47:34] I do wonder if this is not

[01:47:37] that accurate a description of of the United States um

[01:47:41] you know I I don't think we are too populist

[01:47:45] or too Democratic because you know yeah maybe there's a mob of Voters

[01:47:49] but they don't really get to do all that much on a day to-day

[01:47:53] basis and uh and the problem you know I

[01:47:56] I would say is maybe more that uh we're less of a constitutional

[01:48:00] republic than we used to be and it hasn't shifted from the

[01:48:04] constitutional republic to this mob of Voters

[01:48:08] but it's shifted from the constitutional republic to this sort of

[01:48:11] unelected technocratic bureaucracy

[01:48:15] you know the Deep state things like that and

[01:48:19] maybe that's what you need to have in a technologically advanced Society

[01:48:23] where you know you need experts you need you know a Central

[01:48:26] Intelligence Agency you need to have secrets secrets about nuclear weapons

[01:48:30] secrets about other things and so there are all kinds of ways that

[01:48:33] um an advanced technological Society by its

[01:48:37] very nature is far less

[01:48:41] populist or Democratic than the US was even in its 18th

[01:48:45] century conception

[01:48:48] one of the things I've been thinking about since Tuesday but really over the past

[01:48:52] few years is this sort of intermural

[01:48:56] fight um between the elites

[01:49:00] what you've called the Borg or the NPCs or the blob

[01:49:04] um and the group think um they control so many of our institutions

[01:49:08] and the Democratic party and then the what you've described as

[01:49:11] the rebel alliance um there's a

[01:49:15] debate I think happening inside the rebel alliance between people who are

[01:49:19] maybe on the more radical Fringe of it who say um we don't

[01:49:22] need institutions really we don't need Gatekeepers or there's something about

[01:49:26] gatekeeping in and of itself that's corrupting

[01:49:29] um and I think you can see this let let's just I'll use a specific

[01:49:33] example part of this whole like make America healthy again Maha

[01:49:37] movement RFK phenomenon I think is

[01:49:41] very healthy and it's about a skepticism of big Pharma and a skepticism

[01:49:45] you know an idea that you know why should we go along with the fact that there's chemicals

[01:49:49] in all of our food why shouldn't we be skeptical of the fact that

[01:49:53] you know 35% or something crazy like that of American kids

[01:49:56] have pre-diabetes these crazy Health outcomes that let's be skeptical yes

[01:50:00] and but then it can tip just so fast into vaccines

[01:50:04] cause autism territory and I guess I wonder how you think

[01:50:08] about the fine line between um skepticism

[01:50:12] of a maybe an elite whose gatekeeping has

[01:50:16] been too strident or too zealous or too

[01:50:19] narrow and falling into a Rabbit Hole

[01:50:23] or falling maybe off the map where

[01:50:27] you're in a place where there's sort of no gatekeeping

[01:50:32] and no institutional Authority at all does that make sense

[01:50:35] yeah there are not uh man you always ask uh really easy questions

[01:50:40] just I've just been thinking about this one so much because I've watched

[01:50:44] as I've watched the understandable emotional Arc where

[01:50:47] people who were told you're conspiracy theorist only

[01:50:51] to have their conspiracy let say about the origins of covid be proven right

[01:50:55] but by that time they've already fallen off into the deep end where they're

[01:50:59] trafficking and all kinds of things that seem truly crazy

[01:51:03] yeah well um let me uh let me

[01:51:06] articulate one all the different types of Institutions you can

[01:51:10] do you can do this with intelligence agencies or with you know

[01:51:13] um you know um I don't know environmental institutions

[01:51:17] or um but maybe maybe one kind of institution

[01:51:21] where you can ask this question about is science as an institution

[01:51:25] and the way I always think of the history of science

[01:51:29] um was that it it started as a two-front

[01:51:33] war against both excessive

[01:51:38] dogmatism and excessive skepticism and so

[01:51:41] if you are over in the 17th and 18th century a

[01:51:45] scientist was a heterodox thinker who didn't

[01:51:49] believe in let's say the decayed Aristotelian scholasticism

[01:51:53] of the Catholic church and you were maybe were

[01:51:57] empirical and there were these dogmas that um that you were open

[01:52:01] to questioning but you also couldn't be extremely

[01:52:05] skeptical so if you if you you know

[01:52:09] can't trust your senses and if I don't believe you're sitting

[01:52:13] there extreme skepticism is also incompatible with science so extreme

[01:52:16] dogmatism was incompatible extreme skepticism is

[01:52:20] incompatible and the problem problem is yeah it's

[01:52:24] easy to be against one but if you're you know if

[01:52:27] you're always just against dogmatism then maybe

[01:52:31] you're too skeptical of everything and if you're always against

[01:52:35] skepticism you know maybe you're too dogmatic

[01:52:38] and and so there's this very complicated balance

[01:52:42] where we need to be both anti-dogmatic and

[01:52:45] anti- skeptical and you know

[01:52:49] and probably my my feel for it would that

[01:52:53] in the 17th and 18th century

[01:52:57] you know it was probably more anti-dogmatic than anti- skeptical but it was you know

[01:53:00] some of both but if we fast forward to

[01:53:04] 2024 and um you asked

[01:53:08] scientists you know where where is science too

[01:53:12] dogmatic and where is science too where are people

[01:53:16] too skeptical where people being too dogmatic and

[01:53:21] I think there are whole long list of things where they say

[01:53:24] there are climate change Skeptics there are vaccine Skeptics

[01:53:29] there are um there are Darwin Skeptics

[01:53:32] there are you know there are all these people who are

[01:53:36] too skeptical and the skepticism is undercutting science so we're

[01:53:40] we're on war of Skeptics of all sorts

[01:53:44] and then if you asked the scientists where are the scientists too

[01:53:49] dogmatic I don't think they could tell you a single single

[01:53:53] thing where science is too dogmatic and

[01:53:57] doesn't that tell you that we have completely lost the

[01:54:00] sense of balance and we are way too

[01:54:04] that you know we are what what what has become science

[01:54:08] you scare quotes around science is something that is

[01:54:11] more dogmatic than the Catholic church was in the 17th century

[01:54:16] and um that um and that uh you know

[01:54:20] at the margins um

[01:54:23] yeah we you know you can't go all out skepticism and

[01:54:27] there's you know obviously there's a slippery slope to nihilism and you know that

[01:54:30] doesn't work but uh that's you know directionally

[01:54:34] that's where we have to we have to course correct and yeah I I don't

[01:54:38] think you know I don't and then and then you have to go through you know all these specific issues

[01:54:41] and think about it I don't particularly think

[01:54:45] that uh vaccines lead to autism

[01:54:49] um if they did I don't think our science is capable of figuring it

[01:54:52] out because the results would get suppressed because um

[01:54:56] it would um you know it would undercut you know

[01:55:00] the the lobby for vaccinations and you know there obviously are a lot of good

[01:55:03] vaccines do and uh and uh if

[01:55:07] if they if there was some truth to it that would undercut

[01:55:11] it and and I'm pretty sure that question isn't

[01:55:14] being investigated you know there has there has been a dramatic increase

[01:55:19] in autism in in recent decades we don't have particularly good explanations

[01:55:23] for it um surely it's something we we should be thinking

[01:55:26] about more and um yeah so again I I don't think

[01:55:30] vaccines um lead to autism I I

[01:55:34] do think it's the sort of question um that it would be healthy if

[01:55:37] we were allowed to ask a little bit more than we are

[01:55:41] and you know and then and of course um there were all

[01:55:45] you know we just went through this crazy exercise with the the

[01:55:49] uh the co epidemic where you know we somehow

[01:55:53] cut off skepticism so prematurely

[01:55:57] so many times where Not only would was the skepticism

[01:56:01] healthy but the Skeptics were right you know so there were people who were skeptical

[01:56:05] of the um you know of the um eating the bat

[01:56:09] from the food market and know it was it was you you needed

[01:56:12] to be you know you needed not to be so dogmatic

[01:56:16] about the bat eating bats Theory and it was no somehow

[01:56:20] the eating bats theory was the politically correct Theory which is kind of unbelievable

[01:56:24] it's disgusting to a bat what sort of a society is it where people are starving so

[01:56:27] much they need to eat bats you know but I think the fear is

[01:56:31] if you go down the hey maybe vaccines cause autism

[01:56:35] place you can wind up very very quickly in a place where

[01:56:39] polio is back and measles are back because you see

[01:56:42] what I mean yes um how do you know when you've gone

[01:56:46] too far in the skeptical Direction uh well I

[01:56:50] no I I I I conceded there is there's a point where you go too

[01:56:54] far but at the same time my

[01:56:57] my my feel for it is that directionally

[01:57:01] you know the science establishment is

[01:57:05] is way too far in the dogmatic side way

[01:57:08] way too little you know on the skeptical side maybe

[01:57:12] like we take climate change as an issue you know

[01:57:16] um maybe you maybe

[01:57:20] there's there's some part of that I you know I believe is true

[01:57:24] but there are you there are a lot of parts that are open for debate

[01:57:28] you know is maybe methane is a bigger greenhouse gas

[01:57:31] than carbon dioxide in which case it's cows

[01:57:35] flatulating in the Amazon are worse than you know

[01:57:39] um when cars running on oil

[01:57:42] and uh or and then you know you have all sorts

[01:57:46] of questions about um you

[01:57:50] know and then and then yeah and all sorts of layers

[01:57:53] of things that uh that uh

[01:57:57] that can't be discussed so yeah my my

[01:58:00] intuition is these these institutions have gotten very very unhealthy

[01:58:04] you know there's always there's always a culture wars riff I have on this where

[01:58:09] where those of us on the conservative side who are critics

[01:58:13] at the universities often focus on the humanities

[01:58:17] as the part that's you know most corrupt

[01:58:20] most corrupt and most transparently corrupt but the Sciences

[01:58:24] are more esoteric and um and you know

[01:58:29] if um you know the cancer researchers haven't made any progress in curing

[01:58:33] cancer in 50 years or the string theorists made even

[01:58:36] less progress in physics um but these things are so

[01:58:40] esoteric isn't that a hint that maybe the Sciences are even more

[01:58:44] corrupt you know the government analogy I always use is you know

[01:58:47] um which is the most um messed up

[01:58:51] agency the government is it the post office the DMV

[01:58:55] or the NSA the National Security Agency and um

[01:58:59] I would submit it's obviously the NSA because you can go to the DMV

[01:59:03] and the post office and you can see that people are sitting around loafing all day and

[01:59:07] not doing much work and it's obviously corrupt and non-functioning

[01:59:10] and um it's so transparently corrupt that it's maybe not that bad at

[01:59:14] the NSA we have no clue what they're doing and U and then

[01:59:18] my political intuition is that that's a clue that it's

[01:59:22] um it's probably more corrupt more mismanaged than the post office

[01:59:26] or or the DMV we had you know two um

[01:59:29] the you know the Harvard versus Stanford tale of the two University presidents

[01:59:33] that were fired I I was you I went to Stanford is it was Claude

[01:59:37] Dean gay at Harvard it was the um you know the

[01:59:41] diversity um woman who plagiarized all all these

[01:59:44] all these things and everybody could see that there was a lot that

[01:59:48] was ridiculous and was transparent that she deserved to be fired same

[01:59:52] year mark Tessie LaVine the neuro white

[01:59:56] male um neuroscientist who as

[02:00:00] far as I can tell all of his research was multi-decade

[02:00:04] fraud stole tens of millions of dollars but it's

[02:00:07] like you know it's this complicated question

[02:00:11] of you know you know you know are you going to

[02:00:15] go through all these papers and show that the photos were doctored

[02:00:18] in a certain way and and so um

[02:00:22] and so and I'm not saying the Sciences are necessarily

[02:00:26] worse than the humanities but they they've both failed and if

[02:00:30] harder to see you're saying and and then my intuition is that

[02:00:33] that has to be a really important part of the story of what's

[02:00:37] gone wrong with you know with the universities with uh

[02:00:41] with our our society and and uh and

[02:00:45] uh um and there's probably yeah there's probably some

[02:00:49] part where where we haven't asked enough

[02:00:52] questions we haven't been skeptical enough um and

[02:00:56] then this is uh this is where

[02:01:00] yeah I don't know not sure RFK or Joe Rogan or any of these

[02:01:03] people are you know correct

[02:01:07] about everything but it's it's it's so much fresher

[02:01:11] so much healthier than this um

[02:01:15] incredible um Echo chamber that is

[02:01:19] the consensus mainstream media or that is

[02:01:23] the um group think of peer-reviewed science even

[02:01:26] if that skepticism and the freshness

[02:01:30] is coming as it is right now with a lot of

[02:01:35] um there's a lot of ugliness that's attendant to that flinging

[02:01:38] open of the gates let's just put it that way

[02:01:43] yeah although I I want to say maybe maybe we're exposing

[02:01:47] the ugliness that is unfortunately

[02:01:51] part of these things not quite working as well as they're as they're

[02:01:54] supposed to and that you know maybe maybe these institutions have

[02:01:58] have been really really broken for a while and we need to

[02:02:02] and it's we need to somehow find a way to have this conversation let's imagine a

[02:02:05] 100 years from now and someone's looking back at at this

[02:02:10] whole at the story of the late 20th century and then of course the

[02:02:13] 21st century that I think you would argue sort of started late

[02:02:17] if we boiled it all down is it really just all the story

[02:02:21] of of the technological revolution of the internet

[02:02:25] that has fundamentally changed our politics the tone

[02:02:29] of it the language of it that it led to Trump's rise

[02:02:33] that it has brought the collapse of so many of our institutions like

[02:02:36] is that the headline story that you think is going to be

[02:02:41] written yeah I'm always a little bit hesitant

[02:02:44] to make it completely about tech because

[02:02:48] in a way that's the you know when you say that Tech is

[02:02:52] omnipotent omniscient you know if it's not

[02:02:55] Omni benevolent it's Omni malevolent and it's sort of um you sort

[02:02:59] of turn it into you know the judeo-christian

[02:03:03] god or some something like that is um um and then

[02:03:07] and then you know it's always my jardian cut is if you make something

[02:03:10] into god um you are making it into a scapegoat for all the problems

[02:03:14] too and so that's that's sort of where I'm always that that's where I'm

[02:03:18] instinctively hesitant to do this um but

[02:03:21] with that qualification uh yes I think I think it's a

[02:03:25] I think it's an incredibly important change I

[02:03:28] think there are there are ways the internet made things transparent

[02:03:32] that were not transparent and um and

[02:03:36] there are a lot of things that did not work do not

[02:03:40] work as well when they're made transparent you know markets become more

[02:03:44] efficient as they're made more transparent um

[02:03:47] and then scapegoating probably works less well if it's transparent

[02:03:51] you know if we if we think that um you know we have a psychosocial

[02:03:55] problem we need to pretend someone's a witch to solve it it's probably

[02:03:59] we're going to be less motivated witch Hunters and it will not have the kind of

[02:04:03] cathartic effect it might have still had in some you know medieval

[02:04:06] society and um and the question is always is

[02:04:10] politics like markets or is it like scapegoating and the internet

[02:04:14] you know in some ways you know has deconstructed

[02:04:19] exposed you know the politicians

[02:04:23] you know there's there's a way Trump was the first internet president

[02:04:28] and this was a thought I had already in 2016 man all

[02:04:31] the other people they didn't realize how fake they looked they don't realize

[02:04:35] how incredibly fake they are and yeah you could do this

[02:04:39] fakeness in this pre- internet world even

[02:04:42] television was you know a deconstructive medium which was hard for them to master

[02:04:47] but um but the internet was you know it it it

[02:04:50] really exposed the fakeness and then and then

[02:04:54] there is a part of it that feels that feels lossy because these

[02:04:58] institutions don't work as well anymore and I don't you know I don't think we

[02:05:01] can do without them and we haven't quite figured out how to get through to the other side

[02:05:06] um but but I also I also have

[02:05:09] this you know this this is the place where I have a

[02:05:13] I know historicist even Progressive view I don't think you can go

[02:05:17] back and we can't you know you can't uninvent the internet

[02:05:21] and so we have to you know we have to find a way find

[02:05:25] a way through it but but yeah I think I think I think it

[02:05:29] it changed things in in very very big ways you know

[02:05:33] and certainly one can focus on the E economics and the

[02:05:37] you know the incredible wealth creation uh

[02:05:40] but but I think it was also this thing that was you know socially

[02:05:44] and culturally significant there's there's always a science fiction

[02:05:48] riff I have on it and I'm never quite sure this is completely correct but

[02:05:52] uh I think in a way you know there all these science

[02:05:55] fiction books that were written and there are books where they anticipate things

[02:05:59] sort of like the internet where you have like you can go on your computer and you can read

[02:06:03] books on it but but this sort of small packet

[02:06:07] modality of information was like 140 characters on Twitter

[02:06:11] and the ways in which this would radically change the nature of

[02:06:15] society I don't think it was anticipated

[02:06:18] by any science fiction novel to speak of and so

[02:06:22] maybe the internet was the biggest invention

[02:06:26] that was not anticipated by any science fiction

[02:06:29] writer at all and what I what I

[02:06:33] submit to that might tell you is that it represented sort of a change

[02:06:37] in the nature of human consciousness or the structure of our society

[02:06:40] that's that's more radical than we than we think because

[02:06:44] it it was not anticipated by anybody but your

[02:06:48] famous you know your famous line of course is you

[02:06:51] know we were promised flying cars and all we got is 140 characters but maybe

[02:06:55] what you're saying is the 140 characters are more revolutionary they

[02:06:59] they were they are they are revolutionary on a

[02:07:02] social cultural level

[02:07:06] I I always question you know how much

[02:07:10] how much they added to GDP how much they add to economic

[02:07:14] growth um you know there's a way as human beings

[02:07:18] we're I always think we're material we're embedded in Atomic

[02:07:22] world and so if you know if you have a you know

[02:07:26] if you have a shiny surface on your iPhone and the screen you're addicted to and

[02:07:29] you don't notice you're in a Subway in New York that's falling apart

[02:07:33] and you're in a decrepit apartment run with lots of rats in

[02:07:37] it um you know uh you

[02:07:40] know this world of bits you know is not really a substitute

[02:07:44] for the world of atams and so uh there's a way in

[02:07:48] which I still stick with with that

[02:07:51] concern I I would like us to be making progress on all these other fronts

[02:07:55] but uh I I don't want to minimize the

[02:07:59] the way in which the internet was significant politically and culturally even if

[02:08:03] um you know it didn't you know make the Millennials much wealthier

[02:08:07] than the Boomers Peter given the fact that you were I don't

[02:08:10] know if I would say a PR predicted this moment but we're definitely definitely

[02:08:14] early and given how right you are in the bets that you make I think

[02:08:18] people would love to know you know what are the maybe the

[02:08:22] books or the essays that you read that you think best

[02:08:25] either predicted this moment or explain the moment that we're living in wow

[02:08:29] I'm so bad at that uh I'll tell you mine yeah yeah

[02:08:33] I think Martin gur's book The Revolt of the

[02:08:36] public was extraordinary like

[02:08:40] Trump's not mentioned in the book it came out before the whole Trump phenomenon

[02:08:44] he focuses on the Arab Spring and really just the way that um

[02:08:48] the the the tension between the center

[02:08:52] neilus call the Tower and the sare and the way that

[02:08:56] the center the sare sort seed power

[02:09:00] um that's the book I'm recommending a lot to people right now maybe maybe

[02:09:04] I'll give a negative answer um the the one that

[02:09:07] as always the one that somehow

[02:09:11] I think got it completely wrong but I still don't know what it means

[02:09:15] is the fukuyama book the end of history and

[02:09:19] um and

[02:09:23] you know and history was supposed to end in this sort of

[02:09:27] Social Democratic liberalism

[02:09:30] and it you know

[02:09:34] it's sort of unclear and this seemed very correct in the 1990s

[02:09:38] and then you know obviously 9/11 sort of suggested

[02:09:42] that things could move in a somewhat retrograde Direction

[02:09:46] um and then you know and then of course the rise of China

[02:09:51] didn't seem exactly liberal but people had hopes that as China became

[02:09:55] wealthier it would become more Western and more more liberal

[02:09:58] and then you know I always say you know X comes

[02:10:02] to power in 2012 but 2017 is s when he's made president

[02:10:06] for life and in some sense 2017 is maybe

[02:10:09] um the year that the end of History comes to an end

[02:10:13] and uh and then and then

[02:10:17] it's very it's very confusing what this means because we we do want

[02:10:20] to make sense of our history and and where it's going

[02:10:24] and um if it's if it's not over

[02:10:28] uh if it's if it's open uh you know

[02:10:32] I always come back to it's you know we can we

[02:10:35] can talk about Trends and forces but it it it

[02:10:39] it does matter what people do and there's room for

[02:10:43] human Agency for individual Agency for thought and

[02:10:47] uh and I I think part of what will

[02:10:50] shape it I hope our conversations like the one we had today Peter

[02:10:54] teal thank you so much for coming on honestly honestly thanks
