[00:00:03] [Music]

[00:00:16] was about about larger larger questions about the nature of our

[00:00:20] society one one of the big debates uh at at Stanford

[00:00:23] uh um was uh was a debate about the the core

[00:00:27] Western culture curriculum that the freshman were required to take

[00:00:31] and it was a chant uh s reminded of it in a way uh hey

[00:00:34] hey ho ho Western cultures got to go and uh there

[00:00:38] were sort of a you know a group of activists that got mobilized

[00:00:41] they got R got rid of the sort of mandatory Western Civ

[00:00:45] curriculum and in some ways it was a debate about a freshman class but then it was

[00:00:49] a larger debate about about the entire

[00:00:52] uh culture that was being discussed in that class and

[00:00:56] uh and a friend and I David Sachs uh put

[00:01:00] together you know involved in all these debates and

[00:01:04] about 30 years ago 1994 1995 we uh we wrote

[00:01:07] a book uh that was sort of our uh you know tell all book about

[00:01:11] all the insanities of Stanford uh the diversity myth and it's sort of a 250

[00:01:15] page uh you know subtitled multiculturalism and the politics of

[00:01:19] intolerance at Stanford and was sort of a um

[00:01:23] a pasti of 250 pages of you know

[00:01:27] of horror stories about what what the was doing in one way or

[00:01:31] another and uh and I'll I'll just read from from

[00:01:34] one part this is uh this is the uh new curriculum and there's

[00:01:38] Shakespeare's uh The Tempest got replaced by a book

[00:01:42] uh called a tempest which uh was sort of a uh

[00:01:46] inverted revolutionary account in which uh caliban

[00:01:49] the sort of not so good person in the Shakespeare book is the Revolutionary

[00:01:53] hero and it ends with a long di tribe

[00:01:57] against um against Prospero and uh

[00:02:01] the west and so I'll just read the diet tribe from uh um

[00:02:04] the sort of U am CER the um leftwing writer

[00:02:08] of the book understand what I say Prospero for years

[00:02:12] I bowed my head for years I took it all of it your insults your

[00:02:15] ingratitude and worst of all more degrading than all the rest your condescension

[00:02:19] but now it's over over do you hear of course

[00:02:23] at the moment you're still stronger than I am but I don't give a damn for your power or for

[00:02:27] your dogs or your police or inventions and you know why

[00:02:30] it's because I know I'll get you

[00:02:34] um and I know that one day my bare fist just that will be

[00:02:38] enough to crush your world the old world is falling apart

[00:02:42] and by the way you have a chance to get it over with you can [ __ ] off you can

[00:02:46] go back to Europe but in a pig's eye you will I'm

[00:02:49] sure you won't leave you make me laugh with your mission your vocation your

[00:02:53] vocation is to give me [ __ ] and that's why you'll stay just

[00:02:56] like those guys who founded the colonies and how who now

[00:03:00] can't live anywhere else you're just an old Colonial addict

[00:03:04] that's what you are and then we sort of go on like this s 250 pages

[00:03:07] and the you know the conceit is that uh that you know

[00:03:11] we're speaking truth to power and that uh if you just sort of

[00:03:15] expose what's going on that is enough to um

[00:03:18] that is enough to somehow change uh change these debates and of

[00:03:22] course uh you know there's a you know and uh there was a

[00:03:25] there's a wrapper we put around this which was uh which seemed a little bit contrived

[00:03:29] in 1995 but it was sort of that uh you know the reason you

[00:03:33] should pay attention to what happens on these college campuses is because

[00:03:37] ideas of consequences and eventually the ideas spread Beyond College this

[00:03:40] was a very it was a very artificial contrived argument because you

[00:03:44] know it was really just it it felt like just this sort of crazed

[00:03:48] uh very local kind of a debate and then um I don't know

[00:03:51] there's probably like a 20y year for 20 years after

[00:03:55] I wrote this book my retrospective on it was mostly you

[00:03:58] know I don't I don't understand why I wasted two years

[00:04:02] writing this book it was such a waste of time uh

[00:04:06] and uh and then you know the last decade or so I feel better about it

[00:04:10] in in the sort of Cassandra like prophetic sense where you know you

[00:04:14] you you have you have some sort of a prophecy of Doom

[00:04:18] and uh you um you're you know I guess in

[00:04:22] theory you don't want to be proven right but uh sort of as a matter of vanity

[00:04:25] it's always flattering that uh the prophecy of Doom sort of more or less comes

[00:04:29] true and um everything we predicted uh you know in some

[00:04:33] ways happened and you know these ideas spread and and um and of course

[00:04:36] you know in some ways uh you know the uh the conservatives

[00:04:40] or whatever you want to call the The Establishment has uh has just been

[00:04:43] you know fighting a long defeat for uh for many many

[00:04:47] decades um now now there's um

[00:04:52] you know I think one of the one of the pieces of the book that I think has

[00:04:55] held up very well is the title itself the diversity myth

[00:04:59] and and it's uh it's an ambiguous title and I think the

[00:05:03] ambiguity is uh you can put the stress on the word

[00:05:07] diversity and then um there's sort of all these arguments well you know you don't

[00:05:11] it's it's not really about diversity it's it's not you know you don't have

[00:05:15] true diversity when you have a group of people who look different but think

[00:05:18] alike or diversity is more than just hiring you know

[00:05:22] the extras from the space Cantina scen in Star Wars or something like

[00:05:26] that um and that's sort of that's sort of a

[00:05:29] one version of uh of of the title but the the other

[00:05:33] uh deeper version of it is uh to put a stress on the

[00:05:37] word myth that uh you know we actually

[00:05:41] nobody knows what diversity means it's just kind of this empty word

[00:05:45] this shth this Idol that we worship and

[00:05:49] and then um it's it's and there's this mythological

[00:05:53] rapper around it and um and

[00:05:56] and then you know the the uh and the then the point

[00:06:00] of it or you know what's what's going on on one level you know

[00:06:03] is extremely um silly and you have sort

[00:06:07] of debates about all these all these different debates what's what's right

[00:06:11] what's wrong but on another level you have to think of it as as just

[00:06:14] a giant um I don't know a giant

[00:06:18] magic show in which your attention is being redirected from

[00:06:22] things that really matter and it's a it's it's sort of a

[00:06:25] magic show attention redirection operation and what

[00:06:29] I what I want to um speculate on

[00:06:32] a little bit tonight instead of going into all the nuances

[00:06:36] of the pro and anti-diversity arguments on their own terms

[00:06:40] is what is it that our attention is actually being uh directed

[00:06:44] away from what are the things that are much more important that we should be talking

[00:06:51] about EXC

[00:06:55] sorry you'll have your time to make your point

[00:06:59] this this is not the time for audience

[00:07:06] questions sorry if we can have the EMS

[00:07:09] sorry this is not your time to make your point we'll have to remove you from the

[00:07:13] chamber if you want to make a disruption [Music]

[00:07:22] only am I supposed to be shouting you down what what do you want me to do do

[00:07:26] do do you want to be victimized by me women in this room this mon

[00:07:32] very sorry if you want to make your points you'll have the time to do

[00:07:36] that in your audience

[00:07:42] [Music]

[00:07:49] Q&A I I I assume you're not on the paler

[00:07:57] payroll very

[00:08:26] I'll I'll try to offer rebuttal somewhere in my remarks

[00:08:33] technology is no alternative to politics technology is politics

[00:08:38] this man has blood on

[00:08:49] his um well I I I I I will get I will

[00:08:52] I will sort of get get to it by and by but the uh the the 30

[00:08:56] second rebuttal and why I was wondering whether uh the the gentleman

[00:09:00] uh who was uh just for some reason escorted out of the room um

[00:09:03] whether he was working for paler is that uh

[00:09:08] is that uh there's always a question you know my my thesis

[00:09:12] is that most of Technology doesn't even work

[00:09:15] and uh there's always a question you know is it good or evil

[00:09:19] that's the ethical question we always get stuck on but uh so much

[00:09:23] of it is not even it doesn't even work it's

[00:09:26] simply bad it's fake fraudulent bad and

[00:09:30] um and so uh by that man protesting I I

[00:09:34] assume the paler technology at least Works he's not protesting

[00:09:38] IBM he's not protesting Lockheed rathon

[00:09:42] all the vaporware providers and um and so you

[00:09:46] know um if you're even if you're evil

[00:09:50] you're at least not bad you're not incompetent and in a world

[00:09:54] that's full of total incompetence um

[00:09:57] uh uh you're even kind

[00:10:02] good but let's uh I'll uh

[00:10:05] I'll I'll try to get back to that point in some ways

[00:10:09] so uh so I know there sort of are

[00:10:13] are a range of things these uh these um

[00:10:16] these uh these campus debates distract us from probably

[00:10:20] uh probably the first the first big one that I would I would

[00:10:24] submit um it always distracts us from our just

[00:10:27] questions of economics and uh and if you

[00:10:31] wanted a you know a a Libertarian or

[00:10:34] even a Marxist critique of identity

[00:10:38] politics Dei multiculturalism Etc

[00:10:43] is that it's strangely not focused on these economic questions

[00:10:47] and when we are you know when when we are um

[00:10:50] and uh and and there sort of are all these strange ways

[00:10:55] that uh the economy has not worked that well for 40

[00:10:59] or 50 years there are there are reasons for people to be frustrated

[00:11:03] uh the frustration you know often gets gets misdirected but

[00:11:07] but it is sort of this this very deep question of what what

[00:11:10] has gone wrong in in all these different economic spheres and when you

[00:11:14] focus on categories like race um

[00:11:17] or gender or all these other identity categories

[00:11:21] a uh a Marxist critique would be you're not focused on class

[00:11:25] you're not focused on on the nuts and bolts of the economy

[00:11:29] that uh you know if Rosa Luxembourg a the the the Marxist

[00:11:33] theorist of the early you know 20th century if she were here

[00:11:37] she would she would be telling you that that gentleman or you know anybody

[00:11:41] who is not focused on the economy is simply a

[00:11:44] member of the reactionary class that uh that A diversity

[00:11:48] officer at a university is roughly you know it's roughly

[00:11:53] in the same you're you're you're still actually part of a very

[00:11:56] corrupt capitalist Racket and you're sort of in roughly the same

[00:12:00] category as a bank robber or or a prostitute

[00:12:03] you're you're sort of a part of this uh of this very

[00:12:07] very dysfunctional system and uh and and certainly one one of

[00:12:11] the kinds and again you know even the economy is is

[00:12:15] sort of an abstraction I always think the uh the the

[00:12:18] more concrete economic thing to try to focus on

[00:12:22] are are things like housing real estate

[00:12:26] uh I'm I'm always very partial to the theories of Henry George the late

[00:12:30] 19th century Economist who is considered socialist in the late 19th

[00:12:33] century in the early 21st century is considered libertarian sort of a

[00:12:37] symptom of how much our societies have changed in some ways but the uh

[00:12:41] the the rough thesis is that uh the single thing

[00:12:44] you need to always pay attention to in an economy is distortions

[00:12:48] around land use property and if you're not careful

[00:12:52] you end up with uh with um a sort of runaway

[00:12:56] effect in which um the people who are the winners are not the

[00:12:59] technologists or you know various people but

[00:13:03] people who sort of uh won won the housing lottery in one way or

[00:13:07] another and that this leads to sort of a a lot of lot of very

[00:13:10] strange Dynamics and if if one were to think of um

[00:13:14] a university Dynamic if

[00:13:18] all right I I I think you're not going to say anything new here

[00:13:23] so sorry if you want to make your point you can do that during

[00:13:27] audience questions otherwise we'll have have we'll have

[00:13:30] to remove you from the

[00:13:36] chamber

[00:13:45] um um and and and so Bas basically

[00:13:50] uh you know the the if you want

[00:13:53] to make your point you can do so during audience questions like I said otherwise

[00:13:57] we will escort you out of the

[00:14:16] man I I'm so tempted to just

[00:14:20] um never mind I'm not not gonna not I'm going to resist the temptation I will

[00:14:24] keep going

[00:14:28] and um and and the you know um the the example

[00:14:32] I gave at the the Oxford in the Oxford context and

[00:14:35] I suspect that in some ways Cambridge is very similar is was a news

[00:14:39] item that uh you know the old house tolkien's old

[00:14:43] house was for sale for four and a half million pounds

[00:14:46] in Oxford and I would submit that if you are even

[00:14:50] if you are a fully tenured professor at Oxford

[00:14:53] if you were able to buy tolkien's house um

[00:14:57] you should be investigated like where did the money come from

[00:15:01] how did you do this and um and then

[00:15:05] the sort of uh the sort of left-wing radicalism

[00:15:09] from a Marxist or libertarian perspective the economically

[00:15:12] reductionist explanation is this is simply what happens when um

[00:15:16] when the society becomes proletarianized across the board

[00:15:20] and uh and then of course there are sort of a a lot of ways in which

[00:15:24] uh this is this is also uh the the experience of

[00:15:27] of of the uh younger generation in the UK

[00:15:31] the US that you know if we say where where the economy has specifically

[00:15:35] failed it is specifically on this question and

[00:15:39] uh and we should uh it's very hard to solve but uh

[00:15:43] um if we're not talking about that we are um we're missing a

[00:15:46] a great deal and I would um and I would I would submit that the two

[00:15:50] people who interrupted me um I don't have a clue on

[00:15:54] how to fix the housing problem in the UK and maybe that's uh

[00:15:57] maybe that's that's that's a thing that uh they should spend a little bit more time thinking

[00:16:01] about now the the uh the second the second

[00:16:05] sort of broad category of where where

[00:16:09] I think the uh um in in some ways

[00:16:13] uh these these debates distract us from are

[00:16:16] uh are this question of Technology

[00:16:20] science and uh and again the two people interrupted me you

[00:16:23] know they they just assumed all these things are working incredibly well

[00:16:27] that we are we're living in in a world where you know technology

[00:16:31] is progressing at a dizzying pace you know maybe it's

[00:16:35] it's it's accelerating towards distopia but uh

[00:16:38] the uh the uh the thing that I've come to wonder about

[00:16:42] a lot is um is whether this is happening at all how much

[00:16:46] progress is actually happening is the is the slowness

[00:16:50] is it possible that technolog is actually progressing more slowly than we think

[00:16:54] and uh and you know and science is sort of Technology's older

[00:16:58] brother or older sibling who's fallen on especially hard

[00:17:02] times and that uh and that uh somehow the you know the corruption

[00:17:05] of the Sciences is perhaps as great as the corruption of

[00:17:09] the humanities there um you know

[00:17:12] it is it's a very it's it's by the way it's a very hard question

[00:17:16] to figure out what is going on in the Sciences in general you know it's a

[00:17:20] feature of late modernity that we're all hypers specialized everybody

[00:17:24] is working in some super narrow specialty and in some sense to

[00:17:27] comment on the health of all science I have to know something about

[00:17:31] I don't know Quantum Computing and string theory and uh

[00:17:35] and cancer research and you know I have to be an expert on all

[00:17:38] these different things and probably uh nobody since

[00:17:42] Gerta had in the 18th century had a handle on

[00:17:46] everything and and then and then the the suspicion of course is that

[00:17:49] if you can't know what's going on all on all these things and you have ever

[00:17:53] narrower groups of Guardians guarding themselves and the cancer researchers tell us

[00:17:56] they're going to cure cancer in 5 years they've been telling us this for the last 50 years

[00:18:00] and the string theory people tell us they're the smartest people in the universe but

[00:18:04] uh but they somehow it's been sort of a degenerating research program

[00:18:08] for quite some time um it's it's it's very very hard to

[00:18:12] evaluate even though one one suspects that uh that

[00:18:15] the Enterprise is is deeply corrupt um and you know there was

[00:18:19] in the in the American context we had sort of a

[00:18:23] we had this sort of dramatic I would say tale of two different

[00:18:27] universities with University presence getting fired in the last year

[00:18:30] and the very dramatic one was the the Harvard president

[00:18:34] Claudine gay was sort of the you know the um

[00:18:38] I don't know the uh A diversity bureaucrat

[00:18:41] got fired for for plagiarism you know it's sort of

[00:18:45] uh you know it was literal plagiarism even though you know on some

[00:18:49] level you could say that she had not said anything particularly original if she had

[00:18:52] said something original like we need let's say we need to worry about uh

[00:18:56] uh discrimination against Martians if if she if that

[00:19:00] had been her thesis I I would I would guess there would would have been at most

[00:19:03] one other person who would have said that and you would have caught the plagiarism much earlier

[00:19:07] so if you simply were uh copying more or less what thousands of

[00:19:10] people had said um it was a little bit harder to catch the specific plagiarism

[00:19:14] but it was it was deeply unoriginal it was it was sort of like again

[00:19:18] it was it was like what I did my me and my friend did with the diversity with

[00:19:21] book it was sort of shooting fish in a barrel it was really easy to take her out

[00:19:25] and then the the parallel story in a way was

[00:19:29] the uh Stanford University president Mark Tessier LaVine

[00:19:33] who um who was a neuroscientist and

[00:19:36] uh and it's again it's it's a complicated story but

[00:19:40] uh had basically it was basically um the

[00:19:43] the key papers he he had written had all this sort of falsified

[00:19:47] semi fraudulent science and um and on

[00:19:51] some level had you know Abed with tens of millions of dollars

[00:19:54] of government grant money and uh and that was

[00:19:58] also a a tale of uh of of very deep University

[00:20:02] corruption but it's one that's extremely hard to understand it's one people

[00:20:06] were not focused on and somehow um in

[00:20:10] My Telling these are at least two different sides of the coin

[00:20:13] and uh and we need to sort of find a way to to talk

[00:20:17] about both and it's very very hard to do the the science version of this

[00:20:21] my um one of my one of my good friends was a

[00:20:24] physics PhD student in the late '90s and he worked

[00:20:28] for this professor at Stanford uh Bob Laughlin who uh 1998

[00:20:32] gets a Nobel Prize in physics and uh Laughlin suffers

[00:20:35] from the Supreme delusion that once he gets a Nobel

[00:20:39] Prize he finally has academic freedom and he can do

[00:20:43] anything he can finally investigate taboo topics and there are

[00:20:46] you know there probably are sort of a lot of taboo topics in The Sciences you could

[00:20:50] question Darwinism or you could qu question stem cell research or

[00:20:54] climate change but uh he decided it was something far more

[00:20:57] taboo than all these things Laughlin was convinced that uh

[00:21:01] most of the most of the scientists in some sense

[00:21:05] were um were uh not doing any science

[00:21:09] at all they were all they were all like Mark Tessy LaVine they were stealing money

[00:21:12] from the government um and uh and I think they

[00:21:16] started by you know investigating the the biology department at Stanford

[00:21:20] um you can sort of imagine I don't even need to tell you how this movie ended it sort of was

[00:21:24] quite catastrophic uh Laughlin got defunded he got no more grant

[00:21:27] money his students could not get phds and um

[00:21:31] and then the sort of you know shortcut you know because it's hard to know what's

[00:21:35] going on but one sort of epistemological shortcut that I always have

[00:21:38] is that if you have things that are taboo that you cannot investigate

[00:21:43] my um my my shortcut answer is they're simply true

[00:21:47] and so if you cannot investigate the Integrity of the Sciences

[00:21:50] as a whole because it's all you know super um

[00:21:55] uh um complicated um then that

[00:21:58] actually just tells you that the entire Enterprise is pretty

[00:22:02] pretty corrupt and pretty broken and um

[00:22:06] U or or if you want to use a and I have to I'm going to be careful not

[00:22:10] to step on UK sensitivity so I'll try to use a US

[00:22:13] analog so if you if you ask you know what is you know what's the

[00:22:17] you know what's the most corrupt part of the US government

[00:22:21] is it the post office is it the Department of Motor Vehicles

[00:22:24] where you have to just you know wait in line for hours

[00:22:28] um till a bureaucrat fills out the paperwork and you get your driver's license

[00:22:32] or is it the NSA and um and

[00:22:36] the the uh the hermeneutic of Suspicion I have is that the the

[00:22:39] things that are esoteric and complicated you should assume are the most

[00:22:43] corrupt and so the DMV and the post office the

[00:22:47] corruption is transparent just like the corruption in the humanities

[00:22:50] is transparent and so uh so the rough suspicion I have is

[00:22:54] the Sciences are um at least as corrupt as the humanities

[00:22:58] maybe maybe more so and again to you know there's always sort of a little

[00:23:02] bit more of a science science focus at a place like Cambridge

[00:23:05] I I would say that you know um it's always tricky what you're supposed to study as

[00:23:09] an undergraduate I always think one of the ways in which broadly

[00:23:13] the Humanity's people are better off than the scientists is that the Humanity's

[00:23:17] people at least know that they will be unemployable um

[00:23:20] and then whereas whereas these you know it takes a scientist

[00:23:24] to be uh duded into believing that they will be taken care of

[00:23:28] by by the natural goodness of the universe or or something like this

[00:23:32] or uh or if you frame this as a as a debate uh I always I

[00:23:35] always I always think there are basically two kinds of debate techniques

[00:23:39] one can use if you're going after an opponent and you can go after your opponent

[00:23:43] at the weakest point where um and the weakest Point are you know

[00:23:46] all the Ridiculousness in the humanities everybody can see that

[00:23:50] uh the book I quoted from is not quite as good as Shakespeare um

[00:23:54] and that's at the weakest Point you're likely to get maybe a tactic

[00:23:58] win but um but if you go after your opponent at the strongest

[00:24:02] Point um and you win it's game set match

[00:24:06] and that's why that's why I always think we should uh we should call

[00:24:10] out the Sciences a little bit more as well and that

[00:24:13] you know something has gone has gone very wrong

[00:24:17] in most these areas uh you know I think there's progress around computers internet

[00:24:21] the world of bits but it's this narrow cone of progress you know most of

[00:24:25] the areas of science When I Was An undergraduate late ' 80s already didn't

[00:24:28] work you were out of your mind to go into aeroastro engineering nuclear engineering

[00:24:32] and in retrospect everything else didn't work either it was you know you didn't want to go into

[00:24:35] mechanical engineering chemical engineering um

[00:24:39] you know you you didn't want to go electrical engineering sort of barely

[00:24:43] worked although by 1995 it was clearly worse than computer science

[00:24:47] and computer science was I mean it was this fake major in the 80s

[00:24:51] right it was it was you know it was you know normally you know this again sort of this a linguistic

[00:24:55] riff but uh whenever people put the word you know

[00:24:58] I'm I'm in favor of science but I'm not in favor of Science and quotes so whenever

[00:25:02] people call something science You Know It Isn't So political science isn't science

[00:25:06] social science isn't science climate science isn't science it's it's a

[00:25:09] tell that people are suffering from an inferiority complex we don't call it chemical

[00:25:13] science or physical science because those are real and computer

[00:25:17] science it was this um it was this very silly major in the 1980s

[00:25:20] that people who were not good at math or physics or electrical engineering flunked

[00:25:24] out into and uh and and it was sort of a symptom of this inferiority

[00:25:28] complex so it did work but um but it's it's sort

[00:25:32] of more commentary on this uh this this this extremely strange

[00:25:35] world where um where so little else else

[00:25:39] worked there's always this uh this broad

[00:25:43] question why why this uh why this stagnation

[00:25:47] which you know I date back all the way to the 1970s that we've had this period

[00:25:51] of slowed growth reduced expectations for the younger

[00:25:55] generation um you know even the definition of Technology

[00:25:58] you know in a way technology is always defined in a circular way technology is

[00:26:02] that which is accelerating but if you think about what it refers to you

[00:26:06] know I was born in 1967 in 1967

[00:26:09] technology would have meant computers but also medicine and Rockets

[00:26:13] and supersonic Aviation and the Green Revolution in agriculture

[00:26:17] and it meant you know this wide area of different things

[00:26:21] and and where I always have to be careful I'm sort of using technology in the slightly retro

[00:26:25] way but if you use technology in 2024 it mostly

[00:26:28] means just information technology just you know

[00:26:32] this this narrow set of things around uh computer science

[00:26:36] and doesn't the narrowing of the definition of Technology

[00:26:39] tell us that something is something's gone um

[00:26:43] very very uh very very wrong in this in this discipline

[00:26:47] there's um there there are probably one other

[00:26:50] sort of digression on this in terms of the history of the last 50 years it

[00:26:54] still is remarkable it's taken this long for people to figure out

[00:26:58] that something is is really broken and I think I think one

[00:27:02] way to think about it is that there were there were these onetime

[00:27:06] fixes that did not involve Innovation that did not involve

[00:27:10] intensive progress that did not involve Innovation or doing

[00:27:14] a more with less and um there was sort of a center right Reagan Thatcher

[00:27:17] one in the 80s and there was sort of a uh

[00:27:21] um Clinton Blair late 90s 2000s

[00:27:25] version uh the the 80s version was um

[00:27:28] there was a one-time fix to stagnation by uh

[00:27:32] by leaning very aggressively into capitalism and

[00:27:36] it worked I believe it was the right thing to do in the 1980s

[00:27:40] but it was a it it was not a permanent Eternal truth you know if

[00:27:43] you cut tax rates from 70 to 28%

[00:27:47] you will get some you'll unlock some some significant growth

[00:27:50] but you can't repeat that you can't keep cutting taxes in a similar

[00:27:54] way or um or if you you know if you aggressively

[00:27:58] reorganize all the corporations like they did in the US

[00:28:02] and to some extent the UK in the 1980s you fire all these people and you have all these

[00:28:05] sort of mergers and Acquisitions um that can work one

[00:28:09] time but eventually the corporations get reorganized and you don't get

[00:28:13] compounding growth out of this you know McKenzie even Mckenzie

[00:28:17] was a real thing in 1985 and uh it

[00:28:20] was not yet this totally fraudulent racket that it became

[00:28:24] uh later and uh and then um and then I I would say

[00:28:27] the you know probably the virtue of the uh

[00:28:31] of the right of the of the Tory side of the Republican

[00:28:35] side in the US is there's at least some kind of awareness that

[00:28:39] we can't quite go back to the 1980s you know there was a 50e 50-day

[00:28:43] detour with Liz trust in the UK and I probably like her

[00:28:46] the best of the of the five uh uh last five Tory

[00:28:50] Prime Ministers but even I have to acknowledge that somehow um

[00:28:53] the uh the sort of um um detour to the 1980s

[00:28:57] did didn't quite work the um the center left solution

[00:29:01] for how you know how do you how do you create growth how do you have

[00:29:05] progress in a world without innovation without science

[00:29:09] um these the was was was was sort of that you leaned

[00:29:13] into globalization and this was sort of the uh the Blair

[00:29:17] the Blair Clinton conceit it had um it had sort of a you know

[00:29:20] somewhat elongated boom it was probably

[00:29:24] uh it was in some ways a much crer version you know the 19

[00:29:28] 80s the Reagan Thatcher piece was actually relatively egalitarian

[00:29:32] if you look at inequality um it the the president in the US

[00:29:35] where inequality went up um more than anybody else

[00:29:39] was Clinton and it was somehow you know there's something where globalization

[00:29:43] you know even in its Heyday in the 90s and 2000s it was

[00:29:47] again a one-time way to unlock growth you could fire all these

[00:29:51] people you could replace them with uh uh workers who got paid

[00:29:54] on10th as much in China uh there's a way it you know it helped multinational

[00:29:59] profitability but it uh um it it was

[00:30:02] something that had to be done by the central left almost because

[00:30:06] uh because it was um it was so uh cruel in its darwinian

[00:30:10] capitalism or something like that that uh you could never have gotten away

[00:30:14] with it as a as a thatcher or or Reagan person you had to be sort of

[00:30:17] this uh this Central left Blair Clinton type person and then

[00:30:21] um there probably is some level on which um

[00:30:25] the globalization project has been running on fumes it's again

[00:30:29] I don't know if you can reverse it I'm you know it's just like I don't think you should reverse

[00:30:33] the Reagan Thatcher policies of the 80s but uh but

[00:30:36] there's there are not any incremental gains left from it

[00:30:40] and this is kind of where we are stuck today um

[00:30:44] and uh and then this is always where I think we have to somehow you

[00:30:48] know find a path Back to the Future um back

[00:30:52] to uh um the real innovations that will take our

[00:30:56] our our civilization to the next level

[00:30:59] um you know the the you know the third

[00:31:03] third area where I would say uh where

[00:31:07] I would say that uh um you know all of these

[00:31:10] uh all of these sort of uh things have been distracting us from

[00:31:15] are things uh you know maybe maybe the biggest thing of all

[00:31:18] is something like religion um or Christianity

[00:31:22] in particular and if you say that you know there's nothing

[00:31:26] bigger than God something like you know the ontological you know something like

[00:31:30] God is the greatest thing that exists if you can distract people

[00:31:34] and you stop thinking about that that's a pretty effective magic show

[00:31:38] and uh you know there sort of a lot of different ways in which

[00:31:42] you one can ask is the woke diverse

[00:31:46] uh Multicultural you know how is it entangled

[00:31:50] we don't we don't ask these religious questions anymore and uh I think

[00:31:54] I think it is you know it would pay a lot

[00:31:58] um of dividends to somehow ask how it is entangled with Christianity

[00:32:02] it somehow is in in My Telling it's it's it's uh it's

[00:32:05] it's it's not really correct to describe it as simply an

[00:32:09] alternate religion it is somehow extremely adjacent

[00:32:12] to Christianity like Christianity it takes the side of the victims

[00:32:16] you know it's the the Bible you know it's already the story of Cain and

[00:32:20] Abel takes the side of Abel over Cain it's the same story

[00:32:23] as Romulus and Remis but it's Romulus and Remis you know the classical

[00:32:27] story takes the side of the city the Bible takes the side of

[00:32:31] the victim and in some ways you know um wokeness

[00:32:35] all all of these kinds of movements are are um

[00:32:38] are are somehow Downstream from that and then somehow

[00:32:42] uh they are also in some ways just like an almost anti

[00:32:46] christic parody where it is uh you have original sin

[00:32:50] but you have no hope of forgiveness and uh that seems that

[00:32:53] seems like sort of a bad combination theologically speaking

[00:32:57] and so this is where this is where sort of in my in my telling the uh

[00:33:00] you know in some ways the the fundamentalist Christians are the

[00:33:04] more tolerant people and the uh you know the uh

[00:33:08] the woke liberals at you know let's say um I pick on Elizabeth

[00:33:12] Warren at Harvard sort of who's like a Puritan Minister

[00:33:16] from the 17th century from the nastiest part of the Puritan 17th

[00:33:20] century imaginable um and those are the truly

[00:33:24] uh intolerant people at this point but it's it is it is somehow

[00:33:28] extremely entangled with this and uh I think um

[00:33:32] you know I always think there are you know several different perspectives you can

[00:33:36] you know um I'm I'm always emotionally I'm always

[00:33:39] partial to sort of a nian Bronze Age pervert

[00:33:43] type perspective where I don't want to hear about the past I don't

[00:33:47] want to hear about all the crimes that were committed can't we just forget about it

[00:33:51] and move on um and then um

[00:33:54] um but then I think there I think we have to find some

[00:33:58] kind but but then I I keep thinking you know we're not going to be able

[00:34:02] to forget about the past but uh but if we

[00:34:05] if we do the the opposite direction where we constantly recycle

[00:34:09] the past with uh with no hope for forgiveness or

[00:34:13] anything like that um that seems um that seems like sort of a

[00:34:16] bad mirror image of N and bronze AG pervert and all the

[00:34:20] rest of those people um you know to um

[00:34:24] you know now now to return briefly to the question of

[00:34:27] politics you know there's always one version where you know various

[00:34:31] people said you know people interrupted me various people might say

[00:34:35] well you know um yeah maybe diversity has distracted

[00:34:39] us from economics or science or religion but all

[00:34:42] these things are distracting us from politics and that

[00:34:46] the fundamental thing you always have to come back to are these political

[00:34:50] questions and if you you know if you had to say

[00:34:54] um that there's some kind of political thing that we've been

[00:34:57] raed from um here here's sort of the rough candidate

[00:35:01] I would go with and I I always uh like to go with

[00:35:05] the sort of atmology of the term political correctness

[00:35:09] where did this word come from and you know by the 1980s

[00:35:12] it was this term that you know conservatives used to criticize

[00:35:16] people on the left if you go back to the 1970s it was actually something very

[00:35:20] Progressive people said about themselves they're sort of proud you know we're

[00:35:23] politically correct we're more liberal than thou we're you

[00:35:27] know ier than the other liberals and if you went back to 1950

[00:35:31] or so a politically correct person was simply a card

[00:35:35] carrying member of the Communist Party you you were simply taking orders

[00:35:39] directly from Stalin that's what it meant to be politically correct

[00:35:43] um and I always wonder if uh

[00:35:47] if that's uh if if somehow the original meaning um

[00:35:50] might be telling us something something rather important and I know this is

[00:35:54] a in some ways a distortion in some ways a simplification

[00:35:59] but um you know um you could do worse

[00:36:03] than every single time that you hear the word Dei

[00:36:07] to Simply think CCP thank you very

[00:36:10] much

[00:36:15] [Applause]

[00:36:27] thank you so much Peter and just as a reminder to the audience

[00:36:31] you will have time at the end to ask questions what we're now going to do is there'll be some

[00:36:35] time um where I will ask some questions of Peter and then it

[00:36:38] will be over to you to ask some questions um but firstly

[00:36:42] I I think I want to touch on some of what you started

[00:36:46] to talk about in your speech at the beginning and you started by discussing

[00:36:50] how universities and Science and one of the biggest issues

[00:36:54] with them was the idea that they had become about setting a

[00:36:57] fix set of Dogma upon students and within the discipline

[00:37:01] and when you look at how big science universities have

[00:37:05] become of part of our life what do you think the solution

[00:37:08] to that is about the fact that they do instill

[00:37:12] Dogma wow this is again man how do we have all evening

[00:37:16] or how do we um

[00:37:20] uh yes I I I I think I think that's

[00:37:23] true and that's certainly a concern I have I I always

[00:37:27] think that um um one has to a

[00:37:30] little bit like steel maned a little bit at least understand

[00:37:34] you know why there's this tendency towards excessive

[00:37:38] dogmatism in the universities and I would say in particular in the in

[00:37:41] the sciences and I um you know my my one idea

[00:37:45] sort of in the philosophy of science you know what is science and it's

[00:37:48] something that is engaged in a two-front war against

[00:37:52] excess dogmatism and excess skepticism if

[00:37:56] you're too dogmatic can't be a scientist if you're too skeptical if

[00:38:00] I if I don't believe you're sitting here that also probably makes it

[00:38:03] bad to be a scientist and the um you know the early modern

[00:38:07] scientists 17th 18th century you know probably

[00:38:11] you know a lot it was more on the anti-dogmatic side against sort of I don't know

[00:38:14] the decayed aristotelianism of the Catholic church or

[00:38:18] of medieval scholasticism or things like that um

[00:38:22] and um and then um and then you know there's there's some point

[00:38:25] at which this history changed quite a bit and

[00:38:29] I think if you read a um I don't know a a a

[00:38:33] book for a five-year-old it's still describes a

[00:38:36] scientist in these 17th or 18th century terms where a scientist

[00:38:40] is somebody who thinks for herself and who you know

[00:38:44] um somehow looks at the world in

[00:38:48] Wonder um with fresh new eyes and

[00:38:51] and things like this this is not the experience of let's say a graduate

[00:38:55] student in The Sciences where you you are just sort of like you know an

[00:39:00] indentured uh servant at best um you're sort of a robot

[00:39:04] in this uh in this uh giant machine you're a small Cog

[00:39:08] in a big machine and your future is to become an Ever smaller Cog in an Ever

[00:39:12] bigger uh bigger machine and uh and so

[00:39:15] there's something about the balance that's gone very very

[00:39:19] wrong and so there are you know there are all these places where

[00:39:23] where uh the scientific establishment um pushes back

[00:39:27] back against excess skepticism we don't want climate Skeptics

[00:39:31] we don't want vaccine Skeptics we don't want Darwin Skeptics

[00:39:35] there all these places where you're not supposed to be skeptical and

[00:39:38] the uh the question I will just leave for you is give me

[00:39:42] one place where the science establishment thinks that people

[00:39:46] are the scientists are too dogmatic and I submit

[00:39:49] there is no place where they think the scientists are too dogmatic

[00:39:53] and that itself is a tell that we are we are way

[00:39:57] way in the wrong Zone and we've we've uh We've somehow lost

[00:40:01] lost the thread and I touching on the second part

[00:40:04] of that about universities right and the role that science plays in universities

[00:40:08] so you've done a lot of work with the teal Foundation about getting young people to

[00:40:12] rethink their careers outside of a traditional University education

[00:40:16] and going on from that from your opinion what do you think

[00:40:20] is the impact that young people can have outside of a traditional University

[00:40:24] education is that are there any particular areas that we we need to

[00:40:27] divest and divert young people into um aside from

[00:40:31] the traditional University degree man I

[00:40:35] I I always I always feel very bad giving advice here this is obviously

[00:40:39] this is probably the wrong context for people for me to tell people not to go to

[00:40:43] university um it is um so I'm not going to fall for that trap

[00:40:48] um it is uh and then I always I always feel there are ways

[00:40:51] in which I you know I don't know I I I

[00:40:55] I I I suffered from many of these I don't know delusions

[00:40:59] mistakes myself so I'm not necessarily the right person to give advice you know I was

[00:41:03] I was in the 80s early 90s I was always just this hypertrack

[00:41:07] kid you know my eighth grade Junior High School yearbook my best friend

[00:41:10] wrote in you know I know you're going to go to Stanford in four years and

[00:41:14] four years later I went to Stanford and then I went to Stanford law school and then I

[00:41:17] ended up at an elite law firm in Manhattan where I lasted for

[00:41:21] seven months and 3 days and um and from the

[00:41:24] outside it was a place where everybody wanted to get in and on the inside it was a place where everybody

[00:41:28] wanted to get out and I had I sort of somehow was self-aware

[00:41:32] enough of the insanity of all of it that I had a real quarterlife

[00:41:36] crisis in my mid-20s and I did not have as much of a midlife crisis

[00:41:40] later as um most the rest of my uh classmates did

[00:41:44] but um so there is you know there's some kind

[00:41:48] of uh way that uh all of these tracked

[00:41:51] status things um are very dangerous

[00:41:55] uh I don't know what you do instead but that's that is what what has

[00:41:58] been um so catastrophic so misleading you know there's

[00:42:02] some way that uh I think the 2008

[00:42:06] uh Global financial crisis what it meant culturally

[00:42:10] for uh Millennial kids which is sort of an older generation

[00:42:13] at this point but it was somehow the tracks broke down and there was a need

[00:42:17] to rethink this in the US the rethinking pushed people

[00:42:21] towards Tech you know in Europe I think there was sort of much less rethinking

[00:42:25] UK somewhere between uh Europe and the us but if I

[00:42:29] if I had to give you know if I had to give some kind of programmatic

[00:42:33] advice of what people should do and again this is very simplified and reductionist

[00:42:37] it is um everything should be about uh

[00:42:41] programming and deprogramming uh you should learn how to program computers

[00:42:45] because that way you'll you'll be employable and

[00:42:49] you should be deprogrammed as humans and um

[00:42:52] if if you're engaged in an activity where you're not doing one of those

[00:42:56] two you're wasting your time I think that's very good advice

[00:43:00] um but when you so I want to go back a bit and touch

[00:43:04] a bit about what you said on the idea of dogma

[00:43:07] and a fixed set of dogma and then tie that with what you

[00:43:11] said about the rise of technology in the US I think obviously

[00:43:15] there's a lot that's said about free speech today and the state of free speech today

[00:43:20] um and I think one of the issues that a lot of people would say

[00:43:23] that affects Free Speech aside from

[00:43:27] a fix set of Dogma being imposed upon people is the rise

[00:43:31] of technological Mass Avail to you essentially kind of have with

[00:43:35] the rise of tech companies governments that are able to use

[00:43:38] technology to survey their citizens so you have that I mean an example

[00:43:42] of that would be the Modi government in India with the recent elections

[00:43:45] and the way that they use technology um to survey their citizens

[00:43:49] and given the context in W in the ways that technology

[00:43:53] is then used by governments um against citizens

[00:43:57] I'm curious as to what you think the social responsibilities

[00:44:02] if any um are technological companies that

[00:44:05] produce these Technologies well they

[00:44:09] they should push back against it it's it's not always that easy for

[00:44:13] for um the companies to do this they are often quite

[00:44:17] Downstream from you know from from the governments you know I was

[00:44:20] I was on the board of Facebook for something like 18 years

[00:44:25] and um and uh you know my my my defense of

[00:44:28] Facebook meta as it's now called um is

[00:44:32] that uh is that uh you know if

[00:44:36] if you know there's always this very difficult balance

[00:44:39] you had to strike between uh stopping hate speech

[00:44:44] and censoring you know you know um

[00:44:47] true genuine ideas um and uh

[00:44:51] and that balance was very very hard to strike but but uh

[00:44:55] the uh the you know the to the extent that there was an excessive

[00:44:58] censorship regime I think it was very much pushed from the outside

[00:45:02] in where you know these these large companies tend to be Downstream

[00:45:06] of um you know a lot of pressure from the governments and that's

[00:45:10] um that's that's where I would always situate the problem but the you know the

[00:45:13] the the the premises of the question I I would push back

[00:45:17] on more are um you know even if we

[00:45:21] even if we say that there are elements of of the tech

[00:45:25] Revolution that have been dangerous or you know there's probably something about the screens

[00:45:29] that's very addictive and that's you know you know one

[00:45:33] could one could push back on that it is it it always feels

[00:45:36] disproportionate to me for um us to turn Tech

[00:45:40] into the scapegoat and to put 100% of the blame

[00:45:44] on on Tech and um you know is is the reason

[00:45:48] is the reason we're really stuck because you know we're constantly looking

[00:45:51] at our iPhones and they're distracting us from the way in which

[00:45:55] we're in a Subway that's 100 years old old and that's you

[00:45:59] that's part of it maybe that's a 10% or 20% explanation

[00:46:02] but 80 or 90% is we can't build new Subways and we can't build new

[00:46:06] houses and uh we're we're stuck on all these other dimensions

[00:46:10] and that uh you know it's it's so hard for people to innovate

[00:46:13] in all these different areas and there are a lot of complicated reasons why

[00:46:17] why that's the case but uh but I I always think that

[00:46:21] uh we have to somehow find a way to uh to

[00:46:24] um talk about some of the problems with tech without

[00:46:28] turning Tech into simply the scapegoat for everything and

[00:46:32] I want to touch on that really briefly the idea of turning

[00:46:36] Tech into the scapegoat in many situations um and the balance

[00:46:40] between governments and Tech so I think in the case of

[00:46:43] paler specifically I think when I was doing research online

[00:46:47] a lot of the criticisms that people want to make about paler is

[00:46:50] the idea that the technology that paler produces

[00:46:54] um is used to crack down on indiv ual Liberty so often

[00:46:58] the examples that people use to make this criticism is the idea

[00:47:02] of um the example of policing departments across the us

[00:47:05] or even with the protest outside the contracts with the

[00:47:09] IDF and how do you in your position and

[00:47:13] as involved in Palante how do you navigate that balance

[00:47:16] um between governments and Technology man you

[00:47:20] you um you always well you you think about it we have we have very vigorous

[00:47:24] debates inside paler about all these things

[00:47:28] um you know I I personally am think of

[00:47:31] at least I think of myself as as a fairly strong civil

[00:47:35] libertarian um I think that uh you know

[00:47:38] uh P the Genesis of palente here was sort of in the aftermath of

[00:47:42] 911 and um and my you know my political theory

[00:47:46] on it at the time which I still stick with was that we had

[00:47:50] um we had a doing more with more versus

[00:47:53] doing less with less and you could have more security with

[00:47:57] more civil liberty restrictions which was let's say the Dick Cheney

[00:48:00] version of the debate and then there was like an American civil liberties

[00:48:04] Union you have less um um you have

[00:48:07] a less heavy-handed approach but you'll allow more terrorists and more

[00:48:11] terrorism to happen and um and

[00:48:15] uh and the technological answer if the technology is real

[00:48:19] is always you have to find a way to do more with less to have more

[00:48:22] security with uh with fewer infractions on

[00:48:26] civil liberty and I I don't know the emotional reaction I had was you know

[00:48:30] every time I went to an airport and had to take off my shoe that

[00:48:34] felt like an incredible infraction and How likely

[00:48:37] was it that there was going to be another shoe bomber that was going to explode the plane

[00:48:42] and um it was like this one crazy shoe bomber managed

[00:48:45] to you know reorient our whole society and uh

[00:48:49] and if we have if we're stuck if we're limited to these Lite lowtech

[00:48:53] Solutions um you're you're going to have um it's it's going

[00:48:57] to end up being very heavy-handed so the the the the Hope was that you could find

[00:49:01] you know something that's uh that's somewhere in between obviously the surveillance

[00:49:05] works you know in in a lot of different ways where uh um

[00:49:09] if if you have if you have a computerized approach

[00:49:13] there is also at the end of the day there's probably some track record of what

[00:49:16] people in government are doing and uh and the hope

[00:49:20] is that uh that this ultimately it It ultimately

[00:49:24] means that uh uh it limits the kinds of things you can do you can't

[00:49:27] you know um you can do um the really egregious violations

[00:49:31] on the government's side happen when nobody knows what's going on so

[00:49:35] you know are you better off are you better off as an Islamic terrorist

[00:49:38] in Guantanamo or as a suspected cop killer in

[00:49:42] New York City and um yeah there were a few years they were out of

[00:49:45] control in Guantanamo by 2005 the lawyers and the

[00:49:49] inmates had more or less taken it over and um but if you're a suspected

[00:49:53] cop killer in Manhattan you know they they'll just find a way to

[00:49:56] do it off the books and shoot you yeah and

[00:50:01] speaking there and touching on the egregious government

[00:50:05] violations what we have seen more broadly in the United

[00:50:09] States is that the government seems to be posing a challenge

[00:50:13] to the rise of technological development and technological

[00:50:16] entrepreneurialism so and some would call this an

[00:50:20] example of government Outreach so the cases that I'd be referring

[00:50:23] to would be the recent bills about Tik Tok um as as well as

[00:50:27] Government bills about AI generative models and in your

[00:50:31] opinion where do you think the government action

[00:50:35] into technological development extends into the line

[00:50:39] of overreach and reaches into actually

[00:50:42] stifling technological entrepreneurialism

[00:50:47] um well I I

[00:50:50] um you know I I don't know I don't I don't want to give

[00:50:54] simply a do sort of a doctrinaire li libertarian classically liberal

[00:50:58] answer but uh in in My Telling um

[00:51:01] it's in in practice it's almost always overreach in practice

[00:51:05] uh you know I I I I don't think that no government is the answer

[00:51:09] but I think in practice um I would always I would always

[00:51:12] turn the dial back the other way and then uh and then we have

[00:51:16] very complicated debates about you know all of the uh all of

[00:51:20] the all of the specific verticals one could have so I think uh

[00:51:23] you know I I think nuclear power has dangers attached with it

[00:51:27] um but surely um you know the extremely heavy-handed regulation

[00:51:31] where we cannot design any kinds of new nuclear reactors ever

[00:51:34] um has some very high costs especially if we're concerned about climate change

[00:51:39] and and and things like that and we don't want to Simply you know

[00:51:43] uh have the um have the Greta policy of everyone riding a

[00:51:46] bicycle and um and uh and then you know if we if we

[00:51:50] went through the um you know if we went through the AI

[00:51:53] uh debates um uh I I I it's it's

[00:51:57] you know there is a is there's you know there there there is

[00:52:01] a lot of dangerous potential in these Technologies and uh one of

[00:52:05] the points I've tried to make to Sam Alman and all the various

[00:52:08] Pro AI people in Silicon Valley is um is

[00:52:12] that there is a way that you if I scor it as a debate I think the effective

[00:52:16] altruists all these um the Lites the effective altruists they've been winning

[00:52:19] the debates um and they you know they have been they have been

[00:52:23] pretty good at at at scaring people and um and

[00:52:27] you you can't oppose them by just telling a naive

[00:52:31] cornucopian theory of the technology but uh

[00:52:34] but the you know the thing that I I would worry about is that

[00:52:38] uh you know a government that's powerful enough to stop something

[00:52:42] like AI man that that has to be sort of it has to have some

[00:52:45] sort of global totalitarian character and that seems

[00:52:49] really really scary to me so you know one of the one of the

[00:52:53] big organizations that's uh probably been uh fighting

[00:52:57] open AI on the governmental side is the Rand Corporation in Southern California

[00:53:01] which is sort of this public uh private uh thing

[00:53:04] they're very focused on sort of a variety of National Security issues and

[00:53:08] uh and one of the one of the verticals the Rand corporation's been pushing is something

[00:53:12] they call uh Global compute governance and

[00:53:16] um that basically means you need a global government to regulate

[00:53:19] all computers and uh since you know computers are

[00:53:23] they're in some ways they're more local it's just what you put on a keyboard or

[00:53:26] something like that it's uh it's it's it's in a way it's harder to regulate

[00:53:30] computers than something like let's say nuclear power and so Global

[00:53:34] compute governance has a you know it has a very totalitarian

[00:53:38] character to it and if you you know if you held a gun to my head

[00:53:41] um you know I think uh you know I think the power is on the

[00:53:45] the Lite side on the regulatory side and

[00:53:49] um and that's the one I I I find more scary and going back to

[00:53:52] your speech then and looking to the future I mean so

[00:53:56] in your speech you paint this picture of what seems to be

[00:53:59] cultural stagnation across science across religion

[00:54:03] um across technology and education it very much seems

[00:54:07] like we're living in a world where things aren't really going that

[00:54:11] well um and considering what you've said

[00:54:14] I'm curious why do you think we should have

[00:54:18] hope in the future should we have hope in the future um and if so

[00:54:22] how do you think that we can overcome this stagnation where does

[00:54:26] that change kind of begin well um

[00:54:29] I I I don't think the stagnation is absolute um and then you have all

[00:54:33] these questions you know why why it's happened uh there you know there's one argument

[00:54:37] that we've just run out of ideas there's you know all the low hang fruits been picked

[00:54:40] um and I I tend to think it's it's not that the cupboard is

[00:54:44] run out or that the low hanging fruits been picked I tend to think it has to do

[00:54:48] with these regulatory cultural changes where our society's become risk

[00:54:51] averse it's very hard to change culture but but it's not you

[00:54:55] know it's not absolutely possible so I I I don't think it's you know it's it's

[00:54:58] an impossible task I'm always um

[00:55:02] I'm always a little bit however against you know

[00:55:06] um let's say um simple optimism

[00:55:09] or something like this and I um I in some ways

[00:55:13] I um you know I don't want people to be extremely

[00:55:17] optimistic as a corrective to the extreme pessimism

[00:55:20] that that people have um because I I I always think

[00:55:24] that in some ways extreme optimism and extreme pessimism

[00:55:28] are um are very similar extreme pessimism

[00:55:31] tells you there's nothing you can do extreme optimism

[00:55:35] tells you there's nothing you need to do you just um you other

[00:55:39] people are going to build the future you can just sit back and eat some

[00:55:42] popcorn and watch the movie of the future unfold and so

[00:55:46] um both extreme optimism and extreme pessimism

[00:55:50] Converge on sort of laziness and uh and I

[00:55:53] I so I you know I I I I want to have sort of a

[00:55:57] more my my preference would be for a somewhat more nuanced thing there are

[00:56:01] things that are scary about it there things that are very dangerous about our world

[00:56:05] there's some path forward but uh we are most

[00:56:08] likely to succeed if we don't think of it in these you know um probabilistic

[00:56:12] things and if we if we take some agency and if we try to make a difference

[00:56:16] and uh and you know if you want to you know

[00:56:20] um if you want to predict the future you should try to build it

[00:56:23] and speaking of the future and extreme pessimism

[00:56:27] or optimism depending on how you look at and turning over to British

[00:56:31] politics and the UK so when you look

[00:56:35] at the current state of the British political scene it very much seems

[00:56:38] like conservatism and the right um are becoming increasingly

[00:56:42] in poopular so in the UK polling in February by

[00:56:46] the financial times showed that only one in 10 people under 40

[00:56:50] um will vote conservative at the next election um in the

[00:56:53] local elections that we just had the conservatives lost lost about half the seats

[00:56:57] they were defending um and with the general election coming up

[00:57:00] some national polls are showing labor leading by about as much as

[00:57:04] 20 points and considering what you've said about cultural change

[00:57:08] and the way forward for politics and the way forward for

[00:57:11] the way that we interact with politics what do you think

[00:57:15] the conservative party in the UK um and political parties more

[00:57:19] broadly as well in the UK need to do differently heading into

[00:57:22] the general election to perhaps bring about the kind of cultural change

[00:57:26] that you mentioned well I

[00:57:30] I don't know I I I I certainly think that you know I don't want to

[00:57:33] be extremely pessimistic this is probably one place I would

[00:57:37] be inclined to think that uh you know the die is rather cast at

[00:57:41] this point and uh that uh in some sense there have

[00:57:44] been you know um many decades of you know somewhat

[00:57:48] somewhat Mis misdirected decisions you know there are all these things that

[00:57:51] I would um I don't know there's all this advice I would give there

[00:57:55] all these you know conservative politicians I've talked to over

[00:57:59] the years it's it's very difficult you can't convince them of anything

[00:58:02] uh they were they're wrong about China they're confused on immigration they're

[00:58:06] uh they're clueless on technology so there's sort of all these ways I

[00:58:10] can um I I I can say that the the interactions were

[00:58:13] not you know particularly hopeful that I had in in the past and uh

[00:58:17] you know I don't know you know if if you want to I don't know this is

[00:58:21] probably too too violent a suggestion for the milk

[00:58:24] toast reddish people here but uh you if the Tories want to

[00:58:28] win they should just throw every real estate broker

[00:58:32] and person who makes money in real estate out of their party

[00:58:36] and um and then that's you know and then

[00:58:40] and then and then you know there's there's a complicated you know there's a complicated history

[00:58:44] with with the the real estate policy where you had you you didn't create

[00:58:47] new housing um and it was a way for older people

[00:58:51] um property owning older people to save for the retirement because the

[00:58:55] property prices went up and then eventually you had you know you had

[00:58:58] um you know a lot of immigration and you sold the property

[00:59:02] to non-british people and you gradually sold off the family silverware

[00:59:06] and the younger generation was disinherited but it kind

[00:59:10] of It kind of sort of worked and held things together for many

[00:59:14] decades and um and uh one day you wake up

[00:59:17] and you know here here you are and uh

[00:59:21] it's uh it's very hard to have this reset but yes it's just it's

[00:59:25] just uh just the housing conversation that I've had with uh

[00:59:28] it it's sort of like they can't do anything and people will acknowledge yes there's

[00:59:32] a problem but uh you know they have all these older voters that like

[00:59:36] their houses and don't don't want anything new to be built

[00:59:39] and uh and my my my prediction is until

[00:59:43] until they're able to do something about that uh you know I I I I don't

[00:59:47] think the I I wouldn't say that the that starmer

[00:59:50] deserves to win but uh I I I do think the Tories deserve

[00:59:54] to lose thank you and with that we'll head

[00:59:58] into audience questions so way the way this is going to work

[01:00:01] is um once you raise your hand and I pick

[01:00:05] you please wait till you get a mic

[01:00:09] that is an opportunity for you to ask a question and that is then

[01:00:13] an opportunity for Peter to respond and

[01:00:16] then you will hand your mic back to our audience me uh to

[01:00:20] our team and we'll go right at the front there in the SHO

[01:00:26] oh

[01:00:31] yeah thank you so hello

[01:00:36] okay hi um so thank you uh firstly thank you very much for coming to

[01:00:39] speak to us today it's a um fantastic to listen to uh

[01:00:43] so my question is regarding the 20 the upcoming presidential elections

[01:00:47] uh you mentioned you wouldn't be supporting Donald Trump uh would that change

[01:00:51] if he selected JD Vance for as his vice presidential

[01:00:55] candidates man I'm always I'm always

[01:00:59] tempted to go back I I am so determined to try to

[01:01:02] stay out of it but uh um

[01:01:06] I um I I

[01:01:10] I think uh I'm not I'm not going to make an

[01:01:14] announcement of my political intentions here at Cambridge today

[01:01:17] so um you know I'm I um I I

[01:01:21] I I I think I I I think I think I think I think Trump will win

[01:01:25] I don't I I think

[01:01:29] uh sorry this is not your opportunity to ask a question

[01:01:33] of the speaker we'll ask that you sit down otherwise you will be removed from the

[01:01:42] [Music]

[01:01:47] chamber as I said The more time you're spending it's the less time for other members

[01:01:51] to ask questions so

[01:01:54] you will be escorted out of the chamber if you don't sit down

[01:02:04] [Music]

[01:02:08] please man I am to

[01:02:11] respond to that if you if you like I I feel I shouldn't dignify it with a

[01:02:15] response but it is it is just you know this is

[01:02:19] just um you are you you are

[01:02:22] you are it's it's it's it's sort of feel look

[01:02:26] um it sort of feels like the pot calling

[01:02:30] the kettle black or people in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks

[01:02:34] but um you know in my you know in my my telling

[01:02:38] the um the only genocidal thing

[01:02:42] there is Hamas and uh you know they um they didn't

[01:02:46] kill every last Jewish person in Israel but it wasn't

[01:02:50] for lack of desire to do so they wanted to kill

[01:02:53] every last Jewish person and they just did not have the means to do it

[01:02:57] and so if if one element of um

[01:03:01] you know normally the the the the the the int

[01:03:05] the intent to commit a crime is you know is is where

[01:03:08] you know the crime gets committed and this is and so I I keep thinking that

[01:03:12] uh this this this genocide chant and again I don't like to just

[01:03:15] psychologically reduce the people who disagree with me be so psychologically

[01:03:19] reductionist but it it just feels like some kind of a projection

[01:03:24] where the people who chanted are themselves um you know

[01:03:28] uh complicit in this and uh this uh I I don't think

[01:03:32] this does not mean that you know um Israel has

[01:03:36] um um a right to commit genocide or even to

[01:03:39] you know dresd denize Gaza and firebomb them to Smither

[01:03:43] it um I don't think Israel is doing that um but I

[01:03:47] I I do think uh I do think the uh the sort of extreme

[01:03:51] nature of the context um put puts me in a place where

[01:03:55] I'm more on the pro Israel side and uh I think Israel

[01:03:58] should have fairly broad latitude to

[01:04:02] do what it it deems it deems right and necessary

[01:04:06] and we with that we'll move on to another audience question

[01:04:10] as I said The more disruptions we have the less time you'll have to ask audience

[01:04:13] questions so if you want to ask a question that is the time for you to

[01:04:17] ask one question and then give your mic back and then wait

[01:04:21] um him to respond we'll go right at the front there so

[01:04:24] um I I completely sort of I think a

[01:04:28] lot of people in this room and a lot of people who sort of

[01:04:32] have had their views changed over the past couple of months will have started on the 7th of October

[01:04:36] will have been absolutely horrified by I think what you rightly call an active genocide

[01:04:40] but then over the past couple of months will have increasingly been

[01:04:44] sort of falling into dispair supp to falling into horror and sort of you know for

[01:04:47] example um you know 30,000 getting to the point where it's

[01:04:51] 30,000 dead most of them are civilians um there's

[01:04:54] you know combat for footage on the internet of 5-year-olds being targeted

[01:04:58] by sniper rifles in the streets of Gaza and

[01:05:02] aren't there isn't there you know some whatat of a concern that what you're doing and

[01:05:05] what you know your company is contributing to this you know Mass um

[01:05:09] you know Mass Attack of civilians you know Mass death and mass casualties

[01:05:12] and what's you know one of the most destructive

[01:05:16] Wars of the century I look I I I I

[01:05:20] [Applause]

[01:05:24] am uh I I don't I I I don't

[01:05:27] I don't know what your alternative is and um

[01:05:31] and it is um I don't know we're on the you know we're

[01:05:35] at the 30th in in practice I don't think the alternative

[01:05:38] is to Simply let Hamas run things

[01:05:42] and the fake alternative that I think people can only imagine

[01:05:46] to be real in a in a sort of a in as

[01:05:49] decoupled from reality and environment as this is something like

[01:05:53] it should be run by the United Nations or some International

[01:05:57] lawyers committee or or something like this and

[01:06:00] um and I think you know I I I think where again I'm sympathetic to the Israeli

[01:06:04] side is their their view is these things don't actually work

[01:06:08] you know the the United Nations did not protect the randons

[01:06:12] from the genocide in um in 1994 we're the 30-y year

[01:06:15] anniversary of that and um and you know I don't think

[01:06:19] you know I don't think kagame is a perfect human being

[01:06:22] but uh in that in the in that crazy context

[01:06:26] um you know he basically what what he did was basically

[01:06:30] the correct thing and you know a million people got killed while the UN was twiddling

[01:06:34] its thumbs the UN is not able to do something here

[01:06:38] and um and that's that is sort of the that that's sort of the Israeli

[01:06:42] uh perspective they they will not be protected by these fake International

[01:06:46] institutions and then and then it is it is what what is what

[01:06:49] is your alternative you know it's you're if you're dealing with

[01:06:53] uh with uh you know something is in int is

[01:06:57] intentionally genocidal on on the on the Hamas side

[01:07:01] uh no we'll have we I'm sure I'm sure somebody else will ask a followup

[01:07:05] uh so we'll have more time for audience questions

[01:07:08] um we'll go right at the front in the blue

[01:07:18] there um so what do you think about the use

[01:07:22] of artificial intelligence or lavender by the IDF

[01:07:26] in identifying Hamas targets and secondly

[01:07:30] do you agree with Elon Musk about that the population decline

[01:07:34] is a risk for

[01:07:41] Humanity um um look

[01:07:45] I'm not I'm not um you know

[01:07:48] you know with without without um going into

[01:07:52] all the you know I I'm I'm not on top of the details

[01:07:56] of what's going on in Israel because my my bias is to defer to Israel

[01:07:59] it's it's it's not for us to to second guess

[01:08:03] every um everything and uh I I believe that um

[01:08:07] broadly the IDF gets to decide uh what it wants to do

[01:08:11] and that they're broadly in the right and that's that's sort of the the perspective

[01:08:15] I come back to and if I if I fall into the Trap of

[01:08:19] um arguing you on every detailed point I'm I'm actually going to

[01:08:23] I would actually be conceding the the the broader issue that um

[01:08:27] the Middle East should be micromanaged from Cambridge and I think that's

[01:08:31] just simply absurd um and so I'm not I'm not going to concede that point

[01:08:35] um uh and what was your your

[01:08:39] other oh uh

[01:08:43] uh uh man that's again we could spend an hour talking that topic

[01:08:47] but that's I think that uh

[01:08:51] I I think there is something very odd about a a

[01:08:54] world in which people are not reproducing themselves

[01:08:59] um it probably is a is probably somehow entangled with the

[01:09:02] stagnation the decline you know um the

[01:09:06] the sense of pessimism around the future I

[01:09:09] I disagree with Elon in that I don't I don't think

[01:09:13] I I don't think there's some kind of a magic thing you can do around natalism

[01:09:17] and so yes if if if um if you got

[01:09:21] um women to have more children that would somehow be Cor

[01:09:25] at with solving all these problems but the fact that uh um that

[01:09:29] people are not reproducing in all 50 states the US the fertility rates are

[01:09:32] below 2.1 they're low in Italy they're low in South Korea they're low

[01:09:36] in Iran the fact that it's this uh Universal conserved

[01:09:40] phenomenon tells you that it's uh something you know very deep about late

[01:09:44] modernity and it's it's probably there's probably no magic bullet

[01:09:48] solution we'll have time for two more audience questions

[01:09:52] um so we will go uh in

[01:09:56] the black with the glasses

[01:10:12] there oh hello so um thank you so much for

[01:10:16] your talk and um I also read your

[01:10:19] book um zero to one I thought it was a really cool book and

[01:10:23] um thanks for the royalties and

[01:10:27] um what I want to ask was because it's also related to your talk

[01:10:31] is um because you had this chapter about um where

[01:10:34] you mentioned how a lot of people have

[01:10:38] tendency these days to think in terms of like indefinite

[01:10:41] optimism and and especially like

[01:10:46] um like when it comes to biotech startups like

[01:10:49] when you compare you even had this table like comparing biotech startups

[01:10:53] to uh uh software startups and

[01:10:57] how like biotech startups face a lot of challenges such as like

[01:11:01] how much you have to invest in R&D and the heavy

[01:11:04] regulations and how like biology is not

[01:11:08] like artificial or something you can engineer just like

[01:11:12] software and um I was wondering if

[01:11:16] um because he wrote this book I think in was it in 2014 and

[01:11:20] I was wondering if you still think these challenges apply to

[01:11:24] biotech start up today and if so um

[01:11:28] what are the ways by which we can overcome these

[01:11:32] huddles and um

[01:11:36] and aside from this um a follow-up question to that is because I also

[01:11:40] attended uh some A's talk in L in November

[01:11:44] and I thought he was also a really cool guy and I was wondering if

[01:11:48] um with like AI do you think that um

[01:11:52] the progress of innovation when it comes to like

[01:11:55] um biology and life sciences and also the other Sciences like

[01:11:59] what you mentioned like like um do you think it will accelerate

[01:12:02] progress in these fields um especially when compared to technology

[01:12:06] and um or is there something more fundamental that we have to

[01:12:10] change I'm really sorry I think

[01:12:13] I got I got the question I got the question um um

[01:12:17] and I think

[01:12:21] um uh look I think there always are there always are

[01:12:25] sort of two different hats that I I have one is as you

[01:12:28] know as a general Observer of what's what's going

[01:12:32] on in our world and that's the main capacity in which I I spoke

[01:12:35] tonight and then another one is as you know a narrow investor that's trying

[01:12:39] to you know invest in um in these in these specific

[01:12:43] um companies and so I think um you know I

[01:12:47] I think on some level the um the the way in which biotech

[01:12:50] is broadly stalled in which it's extremely hard to get these companies to

[01:12:54] work um you know it's it's somehow it's

[01:12:58] true I I've I've tried investing in many of them over

[01:13:01] the years it's been um much much harder than tech there are all

[01:13:05] these things that that kind of go wrong it's uh

[01:13:09] it would be um it's it's on some level

[01:13:12] it's it's it seems at least as important for our society for our

[01:13:16] welfare as human beings to um to um to make

[01:13:20] progress to improve um um

[01:13:24] improve in the these biotech areas and then um and then

[01:13:28] it's um you know it's it's much much easier said than done and there's

[01:13:31] there you know there's no no simple magic formula and it is

[01:13:35] uh you know it is it's extremely regulated um there are ways it's

[01:13:39] very hard there are ways in which culturally these companies

[01:13:42] uh you know get set up in a in an unhealthy way where

[01:13:46] um you know some at some point people internalize a kind of nihilism

[01:13:50] about the future they they don't believe they don't know what works they don't believe

[01:13:54] anything works um everyone is just a part-time consultant

[01:13:58] and U and it sort of becomes a a negative self-fulfilling prophecy

[01:14:02] and then it's it's not that easy to correct for that if you if you correct and say

[01:14:05] well you know I want I want to only invest in companies in which people really

[01:14:09] believe um then um you know you're you're either you're

[01:14:13] either investing in nihilist Consultants or you turn the dial

[01:14:17] too much and you go um into a a crazy cult

[01:14:21] and that's probably also not always the best for uh for a financial

[01:14:24] return or even for uh for getting things to work and so

[01:14:28] um so yeah there there's sort of a um there's a set

[01:14:32] of very deep challenges around these uh you know I the place where

[01:14:35] I'm you know I guess not wildly optimistic but always

[01:14:39] hopeful is I think there are always things to do at the margins there

[01:14:42] always are you know you can you have to always ask questions

[01:14:46] what can you do what what has not been done why why you know

[01:14:50] um You probably don't want to try doing something that you know a 100 people have

[01:14:54] already tried um and and and so I'm always

[01:14:58] inclined to ask you know why why are there some blind spots where where are

[01:15:01] there some areas where where um where people have not looked

[01:15:05] this is this is always why I you know I I you know I I

[01:15:08] I one of the the questions I asked at my the start of my book is uh the

[01:15:12] this interview question Tell me something that's true that you know very few people agree

[01:15:16] with you on or that nobody agrees with you on and and there's one

[01:15:19] type of answer where the answer is something that's

[01:15:23] um that's like extremely hard to figure out truth it

[01:15:27] takes an IQ of 200 like it's some new um you know

[01:15:31] you solve for Ma's Last Theorem some it's some herculian

[01:15:35] Super Genius thing that only one person in the world can do but then

[01:15:39] um the other you know the other kind of answer is one

[01:15:42] that uh for some reason is socially awkward there's some

[01:15:46] kind of politically correct blind spot and uh and

[01:15:50] my intuition is there are quite a lot of things in that in that second

[01:15:54] category and that's by the way that's why uh you know most of the time if you

[01:15:57] if you tell people an interview question in advance it's a bad

[01:16:01] idea because they can they can game it and they can come up with ways to

[01:16:05] uh to um to come up with fake answers and this is why this

[01:16:08] is a it's an unusually good question if I do say so myself

[01:16:12] because um it can't be gained and I can I so I I can I just describe

[01:16:16] to you all the Dynamics to it but if I if I ask you the question in a one-on-one

[01:16:19] interview um it will still be very hard to answer because

[01:16:23] you you have to tell me something that I'll be offended by most likely and you don't want to

[01:16:27] say that we'll have time for one very

[01:16:30] quick question um and this will be the last question

[01:16:34] of the evening um we

[01:16:38] will go

[01:16:42] right um there in the black check

[01:16:45] yeah

[01:16:58] yeah okay okay thanks scarcity of question

[01:17:03] thank you so Palante released um quarterly

[01:17:07] report a couple of days ago and the there is something that

[01:17:10] lots of investors waited for quite some time namely the

[01:17:14] grow of commercial revenue and in this regard I have a question

[01:17:18] there is a lot of mystery around what paler is doing and

[01:17:22] my question is what exactly does because

[01:17:26] when it comes I'm I'm not let's let's take a different question

[01:17:30] I'm not I I I really don't want to do corporate propaganda and I probably will

[01:17:34] violate some Securities Law if I

[01:17:38] do okay so um thanks so much for coming you spoke a little

[01:17:41] bit about uh the varying qualities of scientists

[01:17:45] and their ability to kind of balance um skepticism dogmatism

[01:17:49] of all the scientists who have ever lived which one do you admire

[01:17:53] the most

[01:17:59] man it's uh I'm always so

[01:18:05] um I I don't know I I think I think uh

[01:18:09] I don't know I I do I do think I I I I can come

[01:18:13] with probably lots of answers but uh but probably probably the early

[01:18:17] modern ones all have this heroic quality so it's Galileo

[01:18:21] people like that um and uh and

[01:18:26] and uh yeah I'm Pro I'm probably still in some ways anchored on this

[01:18:29] retro early modernity of the 17th and 18th

[01:18:33] centuries cool thank you so much um and thank you so much

[01:18:36] Peter for speaking as well thank

[01:18:42] you [Applause]

[01:18:48] um could I please ask that you all stay

[01:18:51] seated while we leave the chamber and then we we will let

[01:18:55] you know when you're allowed to leave so please stay seated

[01:18:58] um until we leave fast thank you
