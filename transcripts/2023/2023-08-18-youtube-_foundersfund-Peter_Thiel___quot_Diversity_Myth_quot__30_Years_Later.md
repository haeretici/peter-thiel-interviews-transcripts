[Peter Thiel: &quot;Diversity Myth&quot; 30 Years Later](https://youtu.be/PjHinnC1xCE)

[00:00:00] if the smartest people in the world are the physicists and they're just going to build bombs

[00:00:04] to blow up the world maybe it's better if they spend their lives puttering

[00:00:07] around with Dei grants and diversity it sort of seems kind

[00:00:11] of pathetic but at least they're not going to blow up the world

[00:00:15] you and I met 15 years ago now

[00:00:19] and back then when we first met I

[00:00:23] think after the first meeting I went and I bought your book I read

[00:00:26] the whole thing cover to cover the diversity myth and

[00:00:31] tried to talk about it with you in our next kind of coffee when

[00:00:34] we were hanging out I think it's very funny now looking back you just I mean you

[00:00:38] didn't want to talk about it at all it was my sense and I felt almost like silly for

[00:00:42] having brought it up you just seemed completely over it this was in like

[00:00:45] 2008 I think when this was happening in my sense

[00:00:49] was that you thought everything that you had written about maybe just

[00:00:53] didn't really pan out maybe a year after I

[00:00:57] started at Founders fund 2012 let's say early kind

[00:01:00] of signs of everything that you had written about were there

[00:01:04] again and by 2015 I would say wokeness

[00:01:08] or Dei whatever we're going to call it had pretty much taken over every single institution

[00:01:12] in the country which makes the diversity myth

[00:01:16] I think to my knowledge the only book that accurately

[00:01:20] predicted basically the last 10 years of America

[00:01:24] and so here we are today 30 years later to do a kind of retrospective

[00:01:28] on that work and maybe have the conversation that we could have had I think

[00:01:31] 15 years ago when I first asked you about it you know I was I was in college late

[00:01:35] 80s early 90s was involved in all these campus Wars

[00:01:39] culture wars uh some of them seem to be just these crazy

[00:01:42] people doing silly things some of them seem to involve Cosmic

[00:01:46] battles there was a you know a big battle in the late 80s at Stanford University

[00:01:50] over the uh core Western culture program

[00:01:53] um is Rally hey hey ho ho Western culture's got to go and

[00:01:57] those in some ways a debate about this one mandatory class that all freshmen

[00:02:01] had to take and another level it was this much bigger debate about our whole

[00:02:05] civilization had to be you know thrown out and then you know my

[00:02:09] friend David sax and I published this book The diversity myth back in 1995

[00:02:13] shortly after we're we're out of college and uh and sort of

[00:02:17] synthesizing a lot of these kinds of arguments

[00:02:21] we it's all focused on on happenings Stanford

[00:02:24] and you have to somehow you have to make some kind of argument that

[00:02:28] what you're talking about matters to other people to the whole country and the somewhat

[00:02:32] contrived argument we made was that you know ideas have consequences that what happens at

[00:02:36] these Elite colleges will eventually spread into the broader Society

[00:02:40] it was it was a somewhat contrived argument and probably by

[00:02:43] the time we met in 2008 it already felt wow

[00:02:47] it was just an embarrassing an embarrassment a way where I sort of turned molehill

[00:02:51] into a mountain or or some something like that and certainly even

[00:02:55] five four five years after I wrote the Book 1999 2000

[00:02:58] during the PayPal years um it was it

[00:03:02] was just not an item it was not something anybody ever asked me

[00:03:06] about I was never asked to explain things in the book

[00:03:09] I was never asked to you know explain my past

[00:03:13] as sort of a right-wing liberal campus libertarian type person the

[00:03:17] vibe of the I don't know 1999.com internet

[00:03:21] was profoundly apolitical optimistic

[00:03:26] and so incredibly disconnected from

[00:03:30] from these crazed culture wars and then uh yeah when

[00:03:34] you forward to the Silicon Valley of the

[00:03:38] last the last few years you know even though in some sense it's done

[00:03:42] so incredibly well as a financial or economic matter

[00:03:45] uh the vibe is sort of angry pessimistic

[00:03:49] you know endless endless culture wars

[00:03:53] um hyper political something like the diversity resonates

[00:03:57] in a very different way and yeah it now feels um prophetic

[00:04:01] you know I suppose I'm kind of proud that I wrote it that I

[00:04:04] could say I was right about everything well in some ways you know it would maybe

[00:04:09] I'd rather live in a world where you know I'd been I'd been less right about things

[00:04:12] and then of course I think there probably are things that I miscalibrated

[00:04:16] and also got wrong there's a question of terms I think is it wokeness

[00:04:20] is it diversity is it Dai what are what exactly are we talking about I

[00:04:24] think it's important because one thing that happens again and again is you're

[00:04:28] asked while talking trying to talk about this abstract thing that

[00:04:31] seems to be sort of pervasive your ass well is it even real if you can't Define

[00:04:35] it does the same thing even exist it seems like you know it's you've

[00:04:39] made it up it is a mountain that you've made out of a molehill there's there's nothing going on here

[00:04:42] well there's there's something very slippery about all the words uh

[00:04:46] you know I think the late 80s early 90s one was Multicultural which has

[00:04:50] probably gone a little bit out fashioned it's more more wokeness diversity

[00:04:53] feels like it's been a quasi-permanent word for for 30

[00:04:57] years so it's probably not the worst one to focus on but

[00:05:01] yes there is something about um the seeming slipperiness of

[00:05:05] it that's uh an important feature um and

[00:05:09] in some ways one of the things that I think has held up extremely well

[00:05:12] is the title of the book uh the diversity myth and it's an

[00:05:16] ambiguous title and you can um you can think of it in one of two ways

[00:05:19] if you put the stress on the word diversity then

[00:05:24] um and then then you then there's this sort of natural critique that follows

[00:05:27] where you don't have genuine diversity on a college

[00:05:31] campus if you have a group of people who look different but think alike that

[00:05:35] diversity you know in intellectual diversity should mean more than

[00:05:38] hiring the extras from the space Cantina scene in Star Wars or something like

[00:05:42] this and this is sort of um and then this was sort of the idea you know people talk

[00:05:46] about diversity all the time but on a lot of important Dimensions

[00:05:49] um they don't really have it it's sort of a powerful internal critique but

[00:05:54] then the the second meaning puts the stress

[00:05:57] on the word myth and um and under this meaning diversity

[00:06:02] is kind of it's a poorly defined word it's something

[00:06:05] we tell stories about it's a kind of shibboleth it's

[00:06:09] a false god um that we're we're worshiping and

[00:06:13] then the kind of questions that that leads to us and maybe it's a diversion

[00:06:17] from things that are uh more important and uh and

[00:06:20] if we're sort of all encamped at the altar of the diversity God what

[00:06:25] are we not paying attention to and this is sort of where you know I've described it as

[00:06:28] a kind of um hypnotic

[00:06:32] um performance or a magic show in which your quasi-hypnotized

[00:06:36] and you can't pay attention to the you know uh orange gorilla

[00:06:40] jumping up and down on the back of the stage or something like that and we have and maybe

[00:06:43] the maybe the question to ask is not sort of specifically

[00:06:47] where one is you know where certain some of

[00:06:51] the pro-anti diversity arguments are are correct but

[00:06:55] uh what are the things that is distracting us from what

[00:06:58] is it diverting our attention away from where is it redirecting our attention that's

[00:07:02] a set of questions that I've come to think are very important and that that didn't

[00:07:06] even register when I wrote the book so I think I think the specific arguments

[00:07:10] the diverse to myth I stand by the vast majority of them I think I think they

[00:07:13] were they were right the people we argued against were wrong but

[00:07:17] then there were all these ways where I think uh David sax and I were were

[00:07:21] not even wrong you know we we were we we sort

[00:07:25] of took these arguments at face value we said these were the important debates and

[00:07:29] we we didn't we had no sense of this this bigger there map

[00:07:32] and how um were other things going on on the map that were

[00:07:36] far more important I do want to just sort of get right

[00:07:40] into basically what you got wrong and this will be I think the premise of the entire discussion

[00:07:44] actually not not even wrong not even wrong right not even aware

[00:07:48] of the question the right question to ask Maybe but first I mean the

[00:07:52] book wasn't just quickly the premise of the book it was not what was going on

[00:07:55] at the Stanford campus that was sort of the background what was the thesis of

[00:07:59] the diversity myth there was a fault line around um this

[00:08:03] debate about um the west Western Civilization you

[00:08:06] know there was one way in which the multiculturalism diversity

[00:08:10] arguments were that we needed to study other cultures in other countries

[00:08:14] and then um the argument we wanted to make was that uh

[00:08:18] it wasn't really sort of uh interested

[00:08:21] in diversity in that sense but it was more you still had all these authors

[00:08:26] that were writing in a western tradition but they were sort of anti-western

[00:08:29] so it wasn't non-western but anti-western so that was sort of a intellectual

[00:08:33] framing in terms of what was going on it was not about learning

[00:08:37] from other cultures but it was about you know tearing our own culture

[00:08:40] and our own Society in our own history down there was this you

[00:08:44] know incredible intensity around identity politics

[00:08:48] and there was already a lot of um of craziness about these

[00:08:51] questions of identity there's you know there was always something paradoxical about

[00:08:55] the way the word you know identity means to diametrically

[00:08:59] opposite things your identity can be that which makes

[00:09:03] you unique or different or your identity

[00:09:07] can be that which makes you identical or the same and then

[00:09:10] you know you have all the people in group X that

[00:09:14] their identities that they're identical to the other people in group X and somehow

[00:09:18] completely different from the people in group Y and then that's sort of

[00:09:21] the the paradoxical definition of identity politics where you you

[00:09:25] start with the meaning both the same and different you know if you start with a word that means a and

[00:09:28] not a you can do a lot of mischief and so there's a lot about yeah

[00:09:33] sort of the paradoxes and insanities of identity politics so you

[00:09:36] were pretty focused there were speech codes at Stanford where you

[00:09:40] know those sort of increasing restrictions in what you could say there were sort of a lot of

[00:09:44] informal speech codes where people you know for the most part you

[00:09:48] know the speech codes were just the tip of the iceberg then people knew you weren't

[00:09:51] supposed to say things or you get in trouble so you were focused on

[00:09:55] essentially the subject of what was happening but you just all these all these sort of

[00:09:59] Campus Wars you alluded to the fact that the

[00:10:02] real story was what we were not paying attention

[00:10:06] to because of it what are they let's just take it in a

[00:10:10] just a brief list before we take them apart I think one by one well

[00:10:14] um probably our different lists one could come up with but four things that I would say

[00:10:18] are bigger than Dei and the Dei

[00:10:22] today or even back then was you know is distracting

[00:10:25] us from the first one would be that um you know in a campus

[00:10:29] context um there's all this focus on the insanities and the

[00:10:33] humanities but somehow The Sciences were more important and

[00:10:37] the thesis I came to in the in the years since is that we have

[00:10:41] lived in an era of General stagnation and Science and in much of Technology

[00:10:45] out of outside of the the computer context and that in

[00:10:48] some ways all the craziness in the humanities

[00:10:52] served the administrators well because it stopped people from asking

[00:10:56] questions about the crown jewels which were the sciences and

[00:11:00] if the Sciences were corrupt this was a in some ways is a much bigger

[00:11:03] indictment of what's going on in a much bigger crisis for us to deal with

[00:11:07] and these sort of intense campus wars

[00:11:11] were actually a very comfortable way to avoid this

[00:11:14] uh this much bigger question about the Sciences there's a

[00:11:18] Marxist or libertarian critique of all these sort of campus

[00:11:22] and culture wars that they distract us from economics from the real

[00:11:25] economic relationships a Marxist would say distracts us from inequality

[00:11:29] a Libertarian from economic growth or how to

[00:11:33] build a more more prosperous world and

[00:11:36] I I think there's you know there's something to both of those critiques

[00:11:40] where you know we have this extraordinary situation where in

[00:11:44] the U.S and the Western world as a whole the younger generation for

[00:11:48] the first time is doing less well than their parents has reduced economic

[00:11:51] expectations that's a that's an extraordinary development

[00:11:55] we should be thinking really hard about how to fix that how to correct that and

[00:11:59] I think in and in some ways as long as we get

[00:12:03] caught up in these in these crazed battles about personal Identity

[00:12:07] or these culture wars we will never tackle these bigger economic

[00:12:10] questions the third one maybe I already alluded to it where you

[00:12:14] know as diversity as as a false god or a false idol

[00:12:18] in some ways functions as a substitute or

[00:12:21] distraction from you know from religion in

[00:12:25] the western context from you know judeo-christian judeo-christian

[00:12:29] tradition and uh in a few I don't know sort of your bit

[00:12:32] friends a little polemically would you say that um you

[00:12:36] know God is the biggest thing that we could possibly be talking about in

[00:12:40] in the in the universe if you're distracted from God that has to

[00:12:44] be the biggest distraction imaginable and and so there is something

[00:12:48] um very strange where I think it's distracted us from that religion

[00:12:52] or uh squeezed certain out certain um religious questions

[00:12:56] and then you know the fourth dimension would be you

[00:13:00] know if you think of you know maybe science and economics

[00:13:04] and religion are in some sense more important than politics but

[00:13:08] maybe they're also distractions from politics and then you know the the Riff

[00:13:12] I always like to have is maybe it's just a distraction you know the the

[00:13:15] etymology of political correctness is uh you know by the 1980s

[00:13:19] and early 90s political correctness was a term that conservatives use to

[00:13:23] describe intolerant liberals go back to the 1970s

[00:13:27] it was a term liberals used to describe themselves if you go

[00:13:30] back to the 1950s um it would actually had a very specific

[00:13:34] meaning and it was you were a politically correct person if you

[00:13:38] were a card-carrying member of the Communist party and you took orders directly from

[00:13:41] Stalin and in Moscow and you just followed the party line and

[00:13:45] I sometimes wonder whether um whether it is

[00:13:49] uh it's it's still just a distraction from communism

[00:13:52] in the context of 2023 from the

[00:13:56] CCP and that whenever people use the word Dei they should

[00:13:59] just think CCP we can drill into all these a little bit more yeah

[00:14:03] in terms of science specifically it seems it's this

[00:14:07] is always the rebuttal it seems like you know there's a lot going on there's like

[00:14:10] the the new molecule and there's I don't know it's rocket

[00:14:14] ships that land what what about what about science is is really broken

[00:14:19] well we can we always start with a meta question how which is

[00:14:22] um do we how how fast is science progressing generally

[00:14:26] how do we measure it how do we know whether it's healthy or

[00:14:30] broken if you talk to the scientists uh it always gets

[00:14:33] framed in these sort of breathless terms you know we are five years away from curing

[00:14:37] cancer nuclear string theories a theory of everything we're

[00:14:41] really close to understanding everything about the universe and there's sort of

[00:14:44] all these you know breathtaking developments around the corner

[00:14:48] and maybe you know maybe it's accelerating too fast it's a dizzying

[00:14:52] pace and we should slow it down those are sort of the the narratives

[00:14:55] you get and then and then it's actually very hard to know

[00:14:59] how you would actually drill down into it you know you know um I'm

[00:15:02] not an expert on string theory or you know what do I know about Quantum Computing

[00:15:06] or cancer the the argument that in a lot of these

[00:15:10] areas things are stalled and slowed is a difficult one

[00:15:14] to to make because in practice you run up against all these

[00:15:18] um sort of self-congratulating these experts um

[00:15:22] uh Guardians guarding their narrow sub-disciplines and telling us how how

[00:15:25] great they are the sense that it has slowed you know there's

[00:15:29] there's an economic sense that some about all this progress has not translated into

[00:15:33] you know better living standards for people there's a there

[00:15:37] is a sense that if we just think about you know the way the

[00:15:42] world changed and you know our I don't know my

[00:15:45] grandparents generation from you know 1900 to

[00:15:49] 1980 1990. that was a world where

[00:15:53] you went to car from horse buggies to cars to

[00:15:56] you know supersonic airplanes you landed on the

[00:16:00] moon um and then the you know the last 50 years there's

[00:16:04] a felt sense that things have changed in computers and

[00:16:07] uh and all these things but almost all the other dimensions less feel uh

[00:16:11] feel feel that way when I was an undergraduate at Stanford in

[00:16:15] the late 80s I always think that um with in in with

[00:16:19] hindsight all the engineering Fields were bad ones to go into you

[00:16:22] didn't want to go into mechanical engineering chemical engineering all these things were

[00:16:26] sort of not really progressing quickly they weren't really Dynamic airwaster

[00:16:30] was a bad idea nuclear engineering people already knew was a very bad idea you

[00:16:34] know I think electrical engineering still had a good decade or two but

[00:16:38] uh the only roughly good field was was computer science which

[00:16:42] was this uh not very challenging field for people who weren't that good

[00:16:46] in math um you know so there's always I always have this riff for things that

[00:16:49] call themselves science our Fields with an inferiority complex and

[00:16:53] so computer science was sort of like climate science or political science it

[00:16:57] was not a science at all and uh and then that turned

[00:17:00] out to be adjacent to the internet and this this one one sector that

[00:17:04] was going to Boom in the next next 30 Years yeah all the hardcore engineering

[00:17:08] Fields went haywire you know there was the founders fund you

[00:17:12] know uh sound bite riff we had on our Manifesto you know back

[00:17:15] in 2011 you know they promised us flying cars all we got was 140 characters

[00:17:19] and so there is some sense that we and we don't have quite the

[00:17:22] Jetsons or Back to the Future future we had 280 characters and now you

[00:17:26] can post entire essays on Twitter sure of course it's progress

[00:17:30] It's Complicated you know the ways and our ways Twitter is important

[00:17:34] culturally and politically and there are ways that it's you know it's a

[00:17:37] uh it's a terrific business and then um there's

[00:17:41] probably still some sense where that by itself is not

[00:17:45] enough to take our civilization to the next level but is your sense on the

[00:17:48] college campus something happened that inhibited

[00:17:52] progress in The Sciences certainly sort of the the basic

[00:17:56] research part of science the the hardcore part of science

[00:18:00] um was in some ways it was not all on campuses but you

[00:18:03] know a lot was adjacent to the universities there were government programs there's some

[00:18:07] some large corporations that were funding it and something started

[00:18:11] to go wrong in that culture you know in the in the 70s

[00:18:14] and and 80s and it was hard to see at the time it's

[00:18:18] sort of more obvious in retrospect it became it became bureaucratized

[00:18:22] there's something about the peer review process where people couldn't do breakthrough

[00:18:25] science there was probably something about you know the signature achievements

[00:18:29] at Los Alamos and Apollo had this sort of you

[00:18:33] know military thing so if if the if the smartest people in

[00:18:37] the world are the physicists and they're just going to build bombs to blow up the world maybe

[00:18:40] it's better if they us if they spend their lives puttering around with

[00:18:44] Dei grants and diversity it sort of seems kind of pathetic

[00:18:48] but at least they're not going to blow up the world and so I think uh yeah I

[00:18:52] think there's some way that it's over determined there were a lot of different things that

[00:18:55] went wrong but uh but I think it generally slowed down a lot in

[00:18:59] the 80s I mean you just you mentioned the exception to that General

[00:19:03] Trend which was computer science and the inferiority complex and

[00:19:06] all that what exactly uh is the reason for that

[00:19:10] is it just the absence of the other science department pressures

[00:19:13] or maybe the degree didn't matter at all and I

[00:19:18] mean the science is I guess the tech was built outside of

[00:19:21] Academia completely if it's the kind of thing where you don't need a

[00:19:25] PhD let's say you don't need a postdoctoral degree or

[00:19:28] a PhD um and it's the kind of thing where you can get to

[00:19:32] the frontier pretty quickly and then once you're at the frontier you

[00:19:36] can start doing new things and so yeah if you're you

[00:19:40] know Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg you can drop out of college your sophomore year

[00:19:43] and um you know you you know enough computer

[00:19:47] science to to start building a great company in in those spaces

[00:19:51] and uh and then probably you know a lot of the other like fields

[00:19:55] um even something like biotech by by the late 80s early 90s

[00:19:59] which was one of the things I I thought of going into at first um

[00:20:02] it already had this very elongated thing where you know you you

[00:20:06] need to at least get a PhD to have sort of a a basic

[00:20:10] entry-level credential and that was maybe in some ways

[00:20:14] a symptom of a field where the frontier was very far away and

[00:20:18] then you know once you got to this Frontier um maybe it turned out not

[00:20:22] as much was happening there as as advertised would it seemed to you that college

[00:20:25] still is not really playing much of a role in development let's say

[00:20:29] in technology rather than science so for example Computer Sciences

[00:20:33] it seemed it does seem like there I mean more people are getting this degree it's

[00:20:36] still the only real outlier it seems like in our economy now there's

[00:20:40] artificial intelligence has the trend sort of kept

[00:20:44] that you don't really need a PhD to progress in the field I

[00:20:48] think it's it's certainly maintained for all the fields outside of computer science where

[00:20:52] I think the you know in 1980s it was it was not clear that the college

[00:20:55] thing was was not working when I was an undergraduate at Stanford I

[00:20:59] would say two-thirds of um the students

[00:21:03] ended up in Consulting law medicine or

[00:21:07] um Investment Banking and you know medicine you get

[00:21:10] an MD well you get a JD banking you got an

[00:21:14] MBA so it's sort of these professional post undergraduate degrees

[00:21:18] and uh and probably all of those things

[00:21:22] have decayed quite a bit you know the hardcore science and engineering

[00:21:26] Fields have decayed a lot more I think electrical engineering still felt

[00:21:30] like a very you know hard and valuable thing

[00:21:33] in the late turned 80s that's that's that's out to

[00:21:37] be much more challenging and then I think there were all these other things that people still

[00:21:40] would have thought of as potentially adjacent and they were they were really on the way out

[00:21:45] when was it working I mean what what would have been an example of

[00:21:49] this in the age before distractions let's say

[00:21:52] in the sciences and Technology when was the when was College really sort of

[00:21:56] coupled in an important way in America with progress

[00:22:00] It's always a question whether ever it ever worked you

[00:22:04] know as the only engine but certainly early

[00:22:08] to mid 20th century you know America there

[00:22:12] was there was a way which I would say science and technology were

[00:22:16] progressing on you know many many different fronts and there was you know I think there was a lot

[00:22:19] of it that you know happened outside of a college context so

[00:22:23] I don't know you know Howard Hughes started building airplanes and uh

[00:22:27] they built the planes before they figured out all the aerodynamic rules

[00:22:30] and you just built the planes and you saw which ones flew and which ones crashed and then you sort

[00:22:34] of retroactively figured out the Aerospace theories

[00:22:38] and so I think there was a lot of things that happened sort of outside of college but

[00:22:41] then there were also all these ways that uh college was it

[00:22:45] was more adjacent to Industry in all these ways it had it had more of a translation

[00:22:49] function um you know the origin of Silicon Valley was you had

[00:22:53] you know I think you had a lot of in a very hardcore electrical

[00:22:56] engineers that had you know fairly intense

[00:23:00] education and then it also got applied it was it was

[00:23:04] a lot more applied there was probably something about the Cold War context

[00:23:08] where um you always wanted to figure out ways to apply

[00:23:11] the science at least to military applications and then it was it was

[00:23:15] really in sort of a in the end of the Cold War in the aftermath that

[00:23:19] it uh it's it spiraled into these these fields that were truly

[00:23:23] inert typically though we'll talk about I

[00:23:26] mean in the past when I've heard you talk about Decline and now we're talking about the 60s and

[00:23:30] the 50s it seems like it began you know long

[00:23:34] before the Berlin wall and the the distractions that

[00:23:37] you've written about in in the 80s was there some shift that took

[00:23:41] place in in the 60s or the 70s it was the sort of where the social distractions

[00:23:45] maybe present on campuses then as well in in a way is

[00:23:49] this actually not the second wave of Dei is it like the third or the fourth

[00:23:53] I think these things were very over determined certainly one

[00:23:56] um you know one underrated part of the story I think is that

[00:24:00] uh um a lot of Science and Technology was

[00:24:03] linked to the military and then at some point this became deeply

[00:24:07] problematic it was already problematic World War one would just led

[00:24:11] to all this Carnage and then certainly uh World War II

[00:24:15] and the immediate aftermath where you know um you know do we

[00:24:18] really need to go from an atom bomb to a hydrogen bomb and

[00:24:22] um you know and and you know is a scientist who's working on that like

[00:24:26] Dr Teller really just a Doctor Strange Love and

[00:24:30] uh by the time you get to Charles Manson in the

[00:24:33] late 60s and you know he's over dosing with his group he's on

[00:24:37] LSD but it's you know what they what they what they see is that

[00:24:41] the world's headed towards you know thermonuclear war and and then

[00:24:44] it's you know probably doesn't logically follow that therefore you can be a dust AF

[00:24:48] skin anti-hero and just go around randomly killing people because everything's promoted

[00:24:52] because the whole world's going to be just Droid but uh but I think yeah I think

[00:24:55] it eventually led to this very crazed Vibe but yeah I I tend to think

[00:24:59] there was something about um there was something about the nuclear weapons

[00:25:03] that uh had the effect of undercutting the

[00:25:07] entire utopian science project of modernity

[00:25:11] of you know 400 years starting the 16th 17th century and

[00:25:15] then in my time it was it was something like a 25-year delayed reaction and

[00:25:18] it it really kicked in the late 60s and 70s there were earlier versions

[00:25:22] but yeah it really kicked in then you know sort of uh related to this entire

[00:25:26] conversation of Academia and the Sciences is

[00:25:30] obviously just College in general and also around the time that I met

[00:25:33] you you created this program the

[00:25:37] 20 under 20 but the premise was you were going to pay I

[00:25:41] think 20 kids to stop out of college just leave school people

[00:25:45] lost their minds it was seen as incredibly controversial but

[00:25:49] now I think it's pretty obvious that you were right this was a major problem

[00:25:53] college debt is that entire conversation is just like

[00:25:56] table Stakes anytime you're talking about college what would you

[00:26:00] say kind of reflecting back on that you know today I think 10 years

[00:26:04] later it already felt very late to me and you know

[00:26:07] I I had I had thought that these institutions had gotten more ridiculous

[00:26:11] more rocket-like more corrupt for for decades

[00:26:15] I I think that already in 2010 it was kind of

[00:26:18] more I was more like the little kid saying the emperor has no clothes

[00:26:22] and yeah so it was it was nobody was saying that it was in some sense controversial

[00:26:26] but um there was surprisingly a little pushback

[00:26:31] and then of course you know the colleges you know it was just an autopilot and

[00:26:34] you know it kept going for for another decade and you know student debt

[00:26:38] was 300 billion dollars in 2000 it it's now two trillion dollars

[00:26:42] so in some sense you know um there

[00:26:45] was enough of it that was just on autopilot people you know didn't

[00:26:49] really know what else to do the anti-college thing it's

[00:26:53] it was The Winning Side in 2010 and it's even more so today

[00:26:57] and yet people are still it seems like people are still going my

[00:27:00] guess is that covid was somehow a big accelerant

[00:27:04] and a big point where we we asked some very hard questions

[00:27:08] about these institutions and man the colleges

[00:27:12] went even even crazier in in that period and

[00:27:16] from my perspective I think yeah they just finally

[00:27:19] jumped the shark but you know I've thought that for decades I I think

[00:27:23] it is just this ridiculous internal Echo

[00:27:27] chamber where they they don't realize how how messed up it's gotten but

[00:27:31] probably there still are a few that it's worth sending your kids to I'm not I'm not

[00:27:35] oh you're you're completely you're over that as well well I'm I'm

[00:27:38] not I'm not sure you know it's it's I think the elite

[00:27:42] colleges you know in the 80s it it was definitely still

[00:27:46] a good thing to get into an elite College like Stanford and

[00:27:50] then there's you know there's there's some point where just from a point

[00:27:54] of view of you know I don't know child

[00:27:57] teenage development it's your it's if if

[00:28:01] entire you know life gets tracked into doing

[00:28:05] all these you know filling out college applications activities and

[00:28:09] you never develop any interests or any passions because it's

[00:28:12] just this you know uh completely contrived resume that

[00:28:16] you're building there's some point where that's you know that has

[00:28:20] to be more of a a liability and you know my my

[00:28:23] sense is that um even for the the kids that get

[00:28:27] into the um the elite colleges at this point it's like you've passed some Mandarin

[00:28:31] examination in in China but you're just

[00:28:35] so exhausted you're never going to do anything more with the rest of your life you're burned out

[00:28:39] at 18. just the other day while I Was preparing

[00:28:42] for this interview the Starbucks Union they're contemplating

[00:28:46] going on strike and they're not going on strike for more

[00:28:49] pay or time off or anything like that they're going on strike because

[00:28:53] they want to make sure that they're allowed to

[00:28:57] put lgbtq decorations in the stores and

[00:29:01] that struck me as like just kind of hilarious in the context of unions right

[00:29:05] you have these famous unions in the 20th century fighting changing

[00:29:09] transforming entire countries um for

[00:29:13] economic power of the working classes and it's you know super

[00:29:16] marxian and in a way here we are in this sort of weird

[00:29:20] space that's supposed to be leftist and uh

[00:29:24] the diversity stuff which is framed as leftist seems like this weird

[00:29:27] subversion of the core thing yeah this is where you know I

[00:29:31] don't exactly believe this but I'm I'm open to even something like the conspiratorial

[00:29:35] Marxist theory Allah Noam Chomsky where obviously

[00:29:39] the Starbucks you Union is just a fake construct that's been invented by the management

[00:29:43] and they're sort of distracting the workers and they're stopping them from really organizing

[00:29:47] for the things that matter and that would hurt the Starbucks shareholders which would

[00:29:50] be paying them a living wage or something like that in some ways is always what's very

[00:29:54] ambiguous about the woke Corporation more generally you

[00:29:57] know is it is it a feature or a bug is it you know is it just

[00:30:01] a form of mass insanity if companies too woke is eventually just going to self-destruct

[00:30:05] and sometimes yes and or or is it more feature

[00:30:09] where um it's just you know a very you know very clever way

[00:30:12] to make the workers forget about their economic interests or their class interests

[00:30:16] and uh to divide them by gender and race and pay them less and

[00:30:20] I think it's sort of a Proto woke corporation that did

[00:30:23] this pretty well was Walmart in the mid 2000s there was all these sort of left-wing

[00:30:27] groups unions we're always saying it's ridiculous people the

[00:30:31] Walmart are paid so little they can't even afford to shop at Walmart those are all these

[00:30:36] um stories are made a pretty good pretty good case on some level

[00:30:39] the Walmart plan was to reinvent itself as a

[00:30:43] green Corporation as as sort of having these sort of eco-friendly

[00:30:47] shopping centers and then that sort of split the anti-left lines

[00:30:51] got Walmart out of the doghouse and it was much much cheaper

[00:30:55] than paying the workers more so I think there are yeah there's sort of our versions

[00:30:58] where it's this sort of Machiavellian rocket and their versions where

[00:31:02] you know it's a it's a crazed ideology and uh

[00:31:06] in the world Corp it probably has elements of both it wouldn't work if it

[00:31:10] was just a racket it wouldn't work it was just an ideology and so you need

[00:31:13] some combination of True Believers and useful idiots

[00:31:17] and uh sort of Machiavellian people taking advantage of the

[00:31:20] whole thing probably the economic Dimension I think there's a tendency

[00:31:24] to focus too much on ESG and corporations

[00:31:28] as sort of the the main vector and I I I think

[00:31:32] perhaps the uh the bigger Vector bigger economic Vector

[00:31:36] um where there are distortions and where um diversity woke

[00:31:40] ideology is distracting us from realities is something like real

[00:31:44] estate um and this is where I'm I'm sympathetic to

[00:31:47] sort of a georgist um economic

[00:31:51] analysis which is uh that if you have distortions in real estate they

[00:31:55] lead to forms of economic Injustice and uh and

[00:31:58] can lead to to really really crazy Society the way I would

[00:32:02] um tell tell this the sort of somewhat strange story

[00:32:06] would be that you know if we were sitting in San Francisco or

[00:32:10] Manhattan back in 2007.

[00:32:13] and um you know I would have said while the rent is so high in these places it's

[00:32:17] so ridiculous and um obviously people this

[00:32:21] can't go on people are just going to move they'll find some other more

[00:32:24] reasonable more affordable place in this country to live if you had told

[00:32:28] me well no in 15 or 16 years the rents will actually be

[00:32:31] doubled um on you know

[00:32:35] I wouldn't have believed you but if you say well I was telling you I you know

[00:32:39] back from the future and the rents have doubled wow there must have been some

[00:32:43] extraordinary ideological superstructure that

[00:32:46] came with that and people must have had there must have been some kind of Stockholm

[00:32:50] syndrome they must have been brainwashed in a really crazy way and uh

[00:32:54] and the the sort of identity politics story I want to tell would be like if you're if

[00:32:58] you're gay you were told that if you you know if you ever left Manhattan if you made

[00:33:01] it even to Hoboken you get beaten up right away or you know

[00:33:05] if you were you know if you're if you're a woman living in a rotten Fest

[00:33:09] apartment in San Francisco and you're daydreaming about a

[00:33:12] nice Suburban house you could have in Reno Nevada for the same

[00:33:16] same price um you know you'll be told that you'll be

[00:33:19] chained to your bed and be forced to carry a baby to term uh

[00:33:23] or something like that and so there was there was some way where

[00:33:27] um if you think of it as uh you know there were somehow trillions of dollars at

[00:33:31] stake for these Urban Lords and you know the zoning and

[00:33:35] the the ideology doubled up to to keep it going that's the Georgia's

[00:33:39] uh real estate story that I think uh was what was

[00:33:43] really going on so the main beneficiaries of this are no

[00:33:47] political candidate it's it's just landlords it's something like

[00:33:51] landlords or you know it's it's older people who own the houses

[00:33:55] um the real estate prices went up so uh correlation does not always

[00:33:59] prove causation but um if there are trillions of dollars at stake we should

[00:34:02] at least ask the question so if the rent's doubled and you had and

[00:34:06] was correlated with people going crazy on identity politics and

[00:34:10] some people made trillions of dollars from that um we

[00:34:13] should at least ask this sort of economically causal story in

[00:34:17] a conversation on the sort of failure of progress uh now in

[00:34:21] the economic Dimension it's a little nerve-wracking

[00:34:25] to be talking so much about Marx um you've previously

[00:34:28] mentioned there's a Libertarian component to this

[00:34:32] as well how exactly I mean what do they what do they both get

[00:34:36] right that has sort of been subverted in the sort of age of

[00:34:39] social distractions well there's there's always some question about

[00:34:43] you know how do you how do you grow an economy I

[00:34:47] think this is sort of probably basically across a lot of different different

[00:34:50] theories if you want to have non-inflationary growth you need you need

[00:34:54] productivity and in some ways that's a question around science

[00:34:58] and technological progress and how much how much were happening and if if

[00:35:01] you don't have productivity growth you could have more inequality or

[00:35:05] the inequality gets felt more severely because it has a very zero-sum

[00:35:09] aspect to it but generally you end up with just

[00:35:12] that Nation I think if you're if you're on the left you stress the the

[00:35:16] um the inequality if you're on the right you stress the

[00:35:20] stagnation but yeah you end up with something that's definitely not

[00:35:23] a progressive Society in any economic sense it's not

[00:35:27] one where people are getting more prosperous and wealthier over

[00:35:31] time it's not you know I've often defined the middle class

[00:35:34] as the people who think that their children will do better than themselves

[00:35:38] and so that the sort of society we have is no longer a middle-class Society

[00:35:42] in that sense so to it's gotten extremely hard to

[00:35:46] um believe that about once one's children last question on the

[00:35:50] economics piece how does this all play out in or

[00:35:53] how have you seen this all play out in the context of companies

[00:35:57] um it seems maybe I mean now Tech seems to

[00:36:01] be entering or is seems to be in this kind of bear Market

[00:36:05] um we've just had a series of

[00:36:09] high profile reckonings with uh

[00:36:12] the sort of political language in the office in some cases it's not

[00:36:16] allowed at all anymore um what what was that

[00:36:20] that phenomena that we just sort of watched happen in which politics became

[00:36:23] a sort of an essential part of the workplace um what is

[00:36:27] your sense of why that happened and and why is it ending

[00:36:31] or do you maybe disagree that it's ending at all it's hard yeah it's

[00:36:35] always so hard to know what's going on in in the moment we're in but uh

[00:36:39] but yeah there was something about um the politicization and

[00:36:42] the intensification in the tech industry

[00:36:47] um was somehow I want to say

[00:36:51] it was somehow the tech was not enough anymore or you know the

[00:36:54] product you were building or the company we're building was not enough

[00:36:58] and um you needed something extra and it was somehow

[00:37:03] um even though you know Tech was still in some broad boom

[00:37:07] and the companies were on the whole doing very well

[00:37:10] um I I don't think it felt that way you know the average person

[00:37:14] in Google felt like they were you know an Ever smaller Cog in this ever bigger

[00:37:18] machine um and then there were sort of ways

[00:37:22] where even if you were at one of the top tech companies uh the

[00:37:25] housing was more and more unaffordable in in Silicon Valley and

[00:37:29] so um so even for uh for um the people at

[00:37:33] The Cutting Edge of tech in Silicon Valley it didn't feel like it was

[00:37:37] it was it was translating individually as well

[00:37:40] as it should happen then crystallized into this very very different

[00:37:44] direction you know I think there was sort of obviously there was

[00:37:48] a there was a way that it coincided with the Trump phenomenon

[00:37:51] politically uh but I I tend to think it was more it

[00:37:55] was more structural people were primed to be angry for lots of other reasons

[00:37:59] was it possible that there was some sort of a distraction

[00:38:03] I mean in the context of monopolies for example you've talked previously

[00:38:06] about how people will try and distract from the

[00:38:10] fact that they are a monopoly we talked about Googling

[00:38:13] um they're also uh you know they have ex-labs and they're you

[00:38:17] know doing a million different sort of crazy science sci-fi

[00:38:21] moonshots and things like this was maybe this was this like the sort of social version of

[00:38:24] that yeah I think I think it worked on all these different levels at

[00:38:28] different places but uh if one were to pick on

[00:38:31] Google there was something about the um the

[00:38:35] moonshot science programs uh that

[00:38:39] was much less charismatic in 2019 than 2014.

[00:38:43] 2014 2015 was still it was all about the self-driving car

[00:38:47] and then you know 10 years later we've kind of gotten there but

[00:38:51] it's it doesn't really capture people's attention anymore Google

[00:38:55] doesn't get a lot of credit for it it's not what Google wants to talk about

[00:38:59] and um and then when they you know

[00:39:02] when when they lost the brand or the

[00:39:06] um or the cachet around um around

[00:39:10] being the sort of place of intense Innovation and you know maybe maybe

[00:39:14] maybe it was too much of a brand and not enough of a reality all

[00:39:17] along but at some point um the time ran out they

[00:39:21] hadn't delivered on it and somehow it was harder to resist

[00:39:25] um the awokening of the of the workforce religion

[00:39:28] is I think a pretty interesting one um it's also

[00:39:32] maybe while the most unpopular of the four

[00:39:35] categories the most obvious and talked about because wokeness

[00:39:40] is sort of constantly referred to um as religious

[00:39:43] in nature what is your sense of how

[00:39:47] it operates in that way well

[00:39:51] um again to be let's maybe concretize it in terms of Christianity

[00:39:55] specifically as sort of a hardcore unreconstructed Girardi

[00:39:59] and I I always I always think of you know what is unique

[00:40:02] about Christianity and as I said the judeo-christian tradition it's

[00:40:06] this story that gets told from the side of the victim it's

[00:40:10] you know Cain and Abel Abel's blood cries out from the ground it

[00:40:14] is um you know Moses leads the Jews out of

[00:40:18] out of Egypt which is this sort of oppressive

[00:40:22] um slave Society in some

[00:40:25] sense Christ is is the victim of the mob of Pontius

[00:40:29] Pilate of the authorities and his is the innocent is the innocent victim

[00:40:33] and then this is this is always sort of a contrast with you

[00:40:37] know most of mythology which tells it from the point of view of

[00:40:40] the persecuting community so the Roman story of Romulus and

[00:40:44] Remus it's like the Cain and Abel story um but it's told

[00:40:48] from the point of view of Romulus um the founder of Rome

[00:40:51] whereas the Cain and Abel stories not told from the point of view of Cain

[00:40:55] who's said to be the founder of the first city so the first city in the history of the world versus

[00:40:59] the greatest city of the ancient world same story different

[00:41:03] different perspectives if you sort of map the

[00:41:07] woke religion into this into this into this

[00:41:10] sort of Christian context um it is not

[00:41:15] it's not wildly Divergent from Christianity

[00:41:19] it's just it is just like one toggle switch away it is

[00:41:22] something like also very concerned for victims

[00:41:26] and um and it is you know there's there's a long

[00:41:30] history in Christianity where there were all these people who said that

[00:41:34] you know they were more Christian than the Christians and it was you know and this was

[00:41:38] you know this was um Marx or Tolstoy in the 19th

[00:41:41] century was yeah Christianity promised you you know the poor shall inherit

[00:41:45] the Earth but we're going to have a Communist Revolution the poor will get the Earth

[00:41:49] right now in the here and now and we're going to be more Christian than the

[00:41:52] Christians and it's not going to be this uh this long

[00:41:56] long story of redemption um it's going to be it's going

[00:42:00] to be a revolution that we're going to do do right now you know that's sort of the the

[00:42:03] history in which I I I see it so it's somehow dealing

[00:42:07] with a lot of the same themes and then um and

[00:42:11] then of course you it um know it escalates them in some ways too where by having

[00:42:15] this concern for for victims maybe you end up victimizing other people

[00:42:18] or um you know uh uh there

[00:42:22] is you know there's a lot of bad

[00:42:26] in history and people did a lot of bad things in the past but

[00:42:30] you know if you get rid of forgiveness that that's a

[00:42:34] that's an important deviation that doesn't work so I think but I think of it as as

[00:42:38] basically something like a you know

[00:42:42] I know Christian heresy sounds too uh old-fashioned but

[00:42:45] it's it's something very very adjacent to Christianity and is

[00:42:49] that the primary difference would be the lack of forgiveness within the context

[00:42:53] of this sort of sure

[00:42:57] but it's also it's also that somehow we have an absolute sense

[00:43:00] of who the victims are um you

[00:43:04] know I think Christianity will always say that some ways

[00:43:08] um we're all part of the you know none of us are pure

[00:43:12] victims the only pure victim was Christ you know the way medieval

[00:43:16] anti-Semitism worked was uh people said you know uh

[00:43:19] medieval Christian said if we lived in the time of Christ we wouldn't have been like those

[00:43:23] bad Jews who killed him um and then of course that's in a sense

[00:43:27] a lack of Christian awareness because what you're supposed to understand is

[00:43:30] you know if you lived in that thing you would have you would have been just as bad

[00:43:34] as Peter who's the disciple who betrays Christ everybody betrayed Christ

[00:43:37] it wasn't just you know the bad Jews or the bad Romans it was

[00:43:41] everybody and then this is you know you could say sort of a I

[00:43:45] don't know a modern liberal atheist in the 21st century would

[00:43:49] say that if we lived in the Middle Ages we would have been tolerant

[00:43:52] unlike those bad medieval Christians and uh and

[00:43:56] there's probably some way where if you say that you would have been different you would

[00:43:59] have known better the Christian critique because that's always like a sign that

[00:44:03] you don't know better there's no chance you'd be better your only

[00:44:07] chance to realize that you would have been just the same and uh if you

[00:44:10] think you're going to be much better uh you have no chance so but so there yeah

[00:44:14] there's some there's something like that is probably the animating idea

[00:44:18] but then there's sort of a question what do you do you know what do you do with all

[00:44:21] this bad history and uh you know I think

[00:44:25] I don't know there's there's I would say maybe maybe outlining the

[00:44:29] three kinds of responses there's kind of a you know

[00:44:33] I don't know anichian Bronze Age pervert Bap

[00:44:37] type thing that that I find emotionally very

[00:44:41] tempting which is um you know the history wasn't that

[00:44:44] bad and I don't want to feel guilty about it and

[00:44:48] not gonna I'm done feeling guilty about the history you know

[00:44:52] there's sort of uh let's say a woke version of the history where it's extremely

[00:44:55] bad and we need to we need to punish all the bad people means you need to separate

[00:44:59] the good people from the bad people and so it's a bad history without

[00:45:03] forgiveness and then no in some sense the

[00:45:06] uh I would say the Orthodox Christian version is that the

[00:45:10] history was was bad and then you need to find

[00:45:14] some way to forgive and then obviously this all gets

[00:45:17] sort of weaponized and turned into something ideological where you know if you're

[00:45:21] if you're too much into forgiveness you're some sort of evil reactionary

[00:45:25] person who wants to downplay the history and if you're

[00:45:29] you know if you're too much into the history um then then you're

[00:45:33] the swoke Christian but uh but there's some kind of balance that

[00:45:36] I think um Orthodox Christianity tries

[00:45:41] to strike in terms of the

[00:45:44] broader conversation on distractions this

[00:45:48] one reminds me a little bit of Science in that it does seem like the

[00:45:52] the decline let's say the decline in religious observance

[00:45:56] in America started a long time ago and it's just been getting worse and worse and

[00:45:59] worse um is your sense that this

[00:46:03] sort of new social religion

[00:46:06] is the reason that religion is declining or has it replaced

[00:46:10] this this vacuum left by a trend perhaps caused

[00:46:14] by something we don't really understand yeah it's always it's always

[00:46:18] hard to know exactly exactly what's what's going on sociologically

[00:46:21] but I I would say that if Orthodox Christianity

[00:46:25] declines um and it

[00:46:29] loses institutional power or things like that my bet would be

[00:46:33] that something like the woke religion will be

[00:46:36] stronger than the bap religion

[00:46:40] um and uh and uh because the woke religion

[00:46:43] is at least right on the on on you

[00:46:47] know just the problem of violence in the past on

[00:46:51] the topic of religion there really has been such a tremendous decline

[00:46:55] a lot of people are going to have a hard time caring and

[00:46:59] uh well one just easy easy sort of obvious question is what

[00:47:03] are the kind of rotten fruits of of a

[00:47:06] decline in religion what are the what is the evidence of that as a problem

[00:47:10] I think there are a lot of different institutional reasons that um

[00:47:14] Christianity is in trouble it's very hard to know how to reverse

[00:47:18] it um I think these I

[00:47:22] think these things can always change people can always you know it's it's these

[00:47:26] things are not you know absolute laws of history that are are written

[00:47:30] out but I I think you know I think the the basic problem

[00:47:33] is you can't it's it's unlikely that you go to a sort of a nietzsian

[00:47:37] heinrand rational East

[00:47:41] Bay atheist thing that's that that's somehow an

[00:47:45] unstable halfway house or it's an it's

[00:47:49] maybe it's an insane asylum for a small number of people there's too

[00:47:52] much of a need for meaning for things like this and uh

[00:47:56] and uh and so I think I think yeah I want to say the woke

[00:48:00] religion filled filled the vacuum and then it's uh I

[00:48:03] think in I think it's I think it's worse than what it replaced

[00:48:07] um and but that's not enough to Traverse that

[00:48:11] science itself is often framed and to a certain extent I

[00:48:14] would say technology is often framed as in some sense at

[00:48:18] odds with religion and so a decline in both seems

[00:48:22] strange and because the opposite would imply they both were

[00:48:26] before the decline there were some golden age when they were both at their height

[00:48:30] um how do they how do you as sort of I guess one of the more

[00:48:34] famously outspoken Christians in Tech how

[00:48:38] do you reconcile the two because it seems like many people see them as just

[00:48:42] completely at odds I mean there's so many different layers to that question there's obviously

[00:48:46] there's obviously a a history where they were institutionally at

[00:48:49] odds and there was you know something about um you

[00:48:53] know early modern science that wanted to resist

[00:48:57] the aristotelianism of the of the Catholic church and

[00:49:01] so there were some historical debates and contexts in which in

[00:49:05] which these things operated but uh but yeah when you

[00:49:09] when you fast forward um to our world

[00:49:12] I do think of the decline is much more correlated in some sense both

[00:49:16] both science and Christianity were

[00:49:20] concerned about the truth and that there could be conflicting truths there

[00:49:23] are ways that could be attention that was a common value and then

[00:49:27] um and then we have somehow moved away from

[00:49:31] that and maybe um maybe that was already implicit in the whole project

[00:49:35] but the sort of ways it it has it has it has manifested

[00:49:39] more and more this line Obama always liked to cite

[00:49:42] quoting Martin Luther King you know the something like the Ark of the universe is long

[00:49:46] and it bends towards Justice or the moral Arc of the universe is long and it bends

[00:49:50] towards Justice and I think that

[00:49:53] uh in some sense you know the the word

[00:49:57] in that sentence that people no longer believe

[00:50:01] exists is the universe and just it's like

[00:50:04] a physics roof but uh the Universe um if the universe

[00:50:08] is one thing then um it leads to certain questions like

[00:50:12] you know was there something that created the universe that's not the universe something like

[00:50:16] God or something like this and somehow it's adjacent to the god question

[00:50:20] and then you can always say well it doesn't it doesn't point to God it's just

[00:50:23] a brute fact there's no explanation for the universe but then

[00:50:27] um then the universe points to a limit on science so

[00:50:31] it either points to God or it points to question science

[00:50:34] can't can't answer and so somehow the

[00:50:38] idea of a Universe um is some at this

[00:50:42] intersection I would say of of this question of let's say

[00:50:45] science and and religion and then

[00:50:49] um and then the way we've pivoted away from the universe

[00:50:53] in the last 20 years is to the Multiverse where we

[00:50:56] can't know anything about the Multiverse as whole as a whole because we're in some completely

[00:51:00] unrepresentative subsection of it and then

[00:51:04] um you can't do induction you can't reason about the whole we

[00:51:08] can't know anything about the whole and that's why um I've often

[00:51:11] said that I think the Multiverse has actually become a kind of gateway

[00:51:15] drug I don't mean this I mean it's actually almost a non-metaphorical sense but

[00:51:19] it's become a gateway drug to the simulation to boltzmann

[00:51:23] brains to uh to The Matrix to

[00:51:27] um you know you're just a brain and a vat being manipulated by mad scientist

[00:51:31] or you're just uh this sort of disembodied mind being

[00:51:35] manipulated by Descartes demon and then it's become

[00:51:38] the Skateway drug to um sort of a world of

[00:51:42] Cosmos that we can make no longer make any sense of it all and you can't make

[00:51:46] sense of you know the whole Cosmos

[00:51:49] maybe you can't really make sense many part of it either but

[00:51:53] uh this is this is certainly not the way the early signs project thought

[00:51:57] of itself in the 17th 18th centuries but

[00:52:00] somehow that in the 21st century um

[00:52:04] I I want to say some of the abandonment of religious truth

[00:52:07] and the abandonment of scientific truth seemed to me to be both symptoms

[00:52:11] of this uh very unhealthy post-modern world where you

[00:52:15] know we live in just uh different uh subjective fictions it

[00:52:18] seems like I mean are you saying is the red pill was a mistake you

[00:52:22] should not this is in the don't take the right I don't think we're I don't think we're in The Matrix I

[00:52:26] don't think I don't think we're in a Multiverse I don't know I'm not sure it's a scientific

[00:52:30] but the sort of pseudoscientific thing has been reframed as a

[00:52:34] as an escape from the theistic or scientific

[00:52:37] questions the universe would point you to they're really compelling

[00:52:41] ideas that are almost impossible to get out I mean the Matrix is one obviously

[00:52:45] the Multiverse is another the simulation Matrix obviously related to the simulation

[00:52:49] Theory uh once you kind of start to think about them there's

[00:52:52] no looking away what do you think it is about them that makes them so

[00:52:56] attractive well that's that's a that's a different question there are ways

[00:53:00] to uh to avoid these ultimate questions and and we're in

[00:53:04] you know we're we're in a world that um you know if you want to

[00:53:07] have Oblivion from the ultimate questions that's that's um that's

[00:53:11] what you that's what you get with with those those things but I think

[00:53:15] um I think the price seems very high and the price seems to be

[00:53:19] that you just can't know anything and you you have to sort of give

[00:53:23] up on ultimately knowing anything about the world

[00:53:26] and my um intuition is that that's

[00:53:30] probably correlated very negatively with a technologically

[00:53:34] progressing Society if you're if you're trying to figure out things about the world

[00:53:37] you're trying to figure out things about parts of the world that's a world where

[00:53:41] your tinkering you're improving you're making it better at least people

[00:53:45] are asking the question I mean this I don't I don't think so we

[00:53:48] just I just agree with you on this I don't think they're they're pretending to ask I don't think

[00:53:52] they really are they've

[00:53:56] asked it in a way where it's designed never to get to answers

[00:54:00] you know if you ask a question in a way where it's designed

[00:54:04] that you can never get to an answer I think that's uh that's actually a

[00:54:07] way to avoid a question or avoid a different question um

[00:54:11] so politics in some sense it seems all

[00:54:15] roads kind of lead here this is the the central piece of it

[00:54:19] all I mean it's right there in the etymology as you mentioned at the top of this thing politically

[00:54:23] correct is Dei a plot by the CCP to take over Silicon

[00:54:27] Valley difficult question answer I don't want to go down the full conspiracy theory

[00:54:30] and then of course let's go ahead and um and take a trip down

[00:54:34] I think it is not the most important question of what the men's Raya

[00:54:38] of these people are are they are they truly

[00:54:41] card carrying members of the Communist Party are they getting instructions

[00:54:45] from Beijing or are they just useful idiots you

[00:54:49] know it's sort of um it's in the intelligence uh

[00:54:53] Community context it's sort of the um the difference between an

[00:54:56] agent and an asset an agent you know an agent

[00:55:00] is um is someone who has full men's Raya

[00:55:04] full full knowledge full intentionality an acid can be

[00:55:07] just a useful idiot of one sort um or or another you

[00:55:11] could similarly ask the question whether you know is Bill Gates China's

[00:55:15] top agent or China's it top asset and

[00:55:19] um seems to me um if it's either of them that's interesting

[00:55:23] enough and we don't need to we don't need to if we

[00:55:27] disagree that he's one or the other that's that's pretty interesting in

[00:55:30] terms of politics what have we been distracted for you're saying it's

[00:55:34] it's communism specifically and it's a threat from China in particular yeah some

[00:55:38] on some level it is uh you know um there's a way in which China is

[00:55:41] a massive geopolitical rival to the U.S

[00:55:45] uh you know it is um you know if China gets

[00:55:49] to have a bigger GDP than the U.S um you

[00:55:53] know does this manifest as some you know great power competition

[00:55:57] Allah you know Victorian Britain against wilhelming

[00:56:01] Germany before World War one and then you know in some ways it

[00:56:04] seems far worse than these historical analogs because

[00:56:09] um it is uh it is it is being driven by a

[00:56:12] you know a totalitarian ideology it's gonna

[00:56:16] I would say leninist you can sort of debate how Marxist it is but but

[00:56:20] certainly um it is sort of a totalitarian one-party control

[00:56:24] and it seems to me yeah the stakes are are very high and

[00:56:27] uh and it's a very important thing for us to think about

[00:56:31] and what we do about it and it's it's hard and

[00:56:35] you know they're sort of you know it was like we have sort of a little bit of this with

[00:56:39] the you know with the uh Germany Russia stuff and the Ukraine

[00:56:42] war we had this one Pipeline and somehow was maybe a

[00:56:46] bad idea to have the pipeline because you were entangled with this bad government maybe you

[00:56:50] know people were somehow naive about these things automatically working and

[00:56:54] the U.S China relationship it seems to me we have you know we have

[00:56:58] a hundred pipelines connecting us with China and we're

[00:57:01] sort of entangled in this in this very bad way it's a it's a very

[00:57:05] unhealthy form of globalization it depends on certain

[00:57:10] um certain unhealthy differences remaining where you know we have a lot of trade

[00:57:13] as long as the world is half slave half free and so yeah I think there are all sorts

[00:57:17] of extremely big important questions about um

[00:57:21] about how one should manage the relationship between China with what's going on

[00:57:24] and and um anything that distracts us from that is

[00:57:28] is very bad and um and we should at least suspect

[00:57:33] that functionally it's doing the job of the Communist party and this is

[00:57:36] they want us to be distracted for surely Target back to go

[00:57:40] back to the Bill Gates thing you're saying it doesn't really matter if we've distracted ourselves

[00:57:43] or if we're being distracted perhaps by them I mean if this is some kind of

[00:57:47] actual psyop the talking points of the

[00:57:50] Bill Gates The Gates Foundation are completely in sync with with

[00:57:54] the CCP on covid on you know on

[00:57:58] foreign aid on globalization you know on all

[00:58:02] all these all these all these sort of things and so you

[00:58:06] know what exactly motivates him is almost a secondary

[00:58:09] question do any of these distracting forces actually work

[00:58:13] against I mean do you think they might work against China

[00:58:16] to some degree for example religion I mean it's an atheist country are they how are they progressing

[00:58:20] uh I mean they seem way more distracted from religion maybe than than

[00:58:24] we are we at least have wokeness thought

[00:58:30] is that their version of it is I don't know it's it's probably a lot

[00:58:34] I I take wokeness over that any day but yeah no they're they're probably

[00:58:38] are different ways this this this this manifests over there

[00:58:42] there are I don't know there are a lot of things

[00:58:45] that are very crazy about China there are a lot of reasons to think that it

[00:58:49] um it will not ultimately quite succeed

[00:58:53] but but I also think we shouldn't tell

[00:58:56] ourselves that they're automatically going to self-destruct you know they're sort of I think there's sort

[00:59:00] of these these two narratives we generally tell about China One

[00:59:04] is that they're going to take over the world which just accept it and the

[00:59:07] other is that um you know no one's having kids the whole society is gonna

[00:59:11] is going to self-destruct and we don't need to take it seriously and we

[00:59:15] can ignore it and so it's it's acceptance or denial the

[00:59:18] truth probably is and it's probably healthier to think that the truth is

[00:59:22] somewhere in between and that what we need to do is actually you

[00:59:26] know um think really hard through how do you how

[00:59:29] do you block and tackle it what do you what do you do about semiconductor policy

[00:59:33] with China it's very complicated you need to figure it out and

[00:59:37] uh you know what do you do with trade where is it okay to trade where is it not okay to trade

[00:59:41] you know where where do you where do you push back where do

[00:59:45] you not push back but it's it's a very hard fight we have on our hands

[00:59:48] we're distractions from science um academics

[00:59:52] economics and religion seems sort of ambiguous

[00:59:56] it's hard to pin down when exactly the decline began it's

[01:00:00] clear that Dei this sort of broad multiculturalism whatever

[01:00:04] the sort of distracting social stuff that you've talked about has a

[01:00:08] huge role there politics seems more obvious it

[01:00:12] seems like the fall of the Berlin Wall was pretty much the moment

[01:00:15] that the distractions began once Russia was gone and it was no longer a serious threat

[01:00:19] or no longer perceived as a serious threat to us

[01:00:23] um we stopped thinking about about this I wonder what

[01:00:27] is it about China that makes it so hard to care um as opposed

[01:00:30] to the USSR well I mean there's there's a I mean there's all sorts of different

[01:00:34] answers there's there's obviously there's the end of the Cold War history in the 70s and 80s

[01:00:38] where you know um even anti-communists like Nixon and Reagan

[01:00:41] the strategy was um to Ally

[01:00:45] with the weaker China against the more powerful Soviet unions

[01:00:49] was the Kissinger opening to China in 1972 it was it was

[01:00:53] uh in some ways the Reagan Administration continued this

[01:00:56] um and um you know even even when they killed all those people on

[01:01:00] Tiananmen Square in June of 1989 within a month Brent's gocroft the

[01:01:04] Bush 41 National Security advisor was in Beijing saying we don't care because

[01:01:08] you're anti-soviet you know Berlin Wall didn't come down until six months

[01:01:12] later and I I sometimes think if the history had been the opposite if

[01:01:15] 10 minutes happened a year later then maybe we could have reacted

[01:01:19] very differently but there was a way in the 70s and 80s where China

[01:01:22] was seen as a an ally I'll be at

[01:01:26] a crazed communist one against a more powerful

[01:01:30] uh Soviet Union there's a certain real politic and then

[01:01:33] there's some way that needed to be updated and it wasn't and

[01:01:37] then and then I think the the Berlin Wall coming down was you

[01:01:41] know it was basically it got interpreted in two very different ways in

[01:01:45] China and in the West in in the west we interpreted

[01:01:48] it as wow these systems will collapse under their own

[01:01:52] weight and we just need to wait them out and

[01:01:56] um and something like the Berlin Wall will eventually come down and you know all

[01:02:00] these other places um China Vietnam North

[01:02:04] Korea places like that on the other hand in China it got

[01:02:08] interpreted as wow we have to really learn from what happened

[01:02:11] in the Soviet Union avoid making those mistakes and you know Gorbachev

[01:02:15] had perestroika economic restructuring which

[01:02:19] is good but gloss knows political opening that's bad and

[01:02:22] so we'll do it with love prayer story but no glasnost and and

[01:02:26] we'll learn from it and if we learn from it we can avoid that from happening and

[01:02:30] so the downside of the Berlin Wall coming down in this almost miraculous

[01:02:34] way in communism collapsing in this miraculous way in Eastern

[01:02:38] Europe in the late 80s early 90s was that we thought it was going

[01:02:41] to be too easy with China and then in fact China learned lessons on

[01:02:45] how to how to shore up their system and and

[01:02:49] uh and then we are where we are today it does kind of seem at

[01:02:53] this point that all of the social distractions

[01:02:57] are kind of at an end or at least they're not at the peak it feels like the

[01:03:00] peak was something like 2020. it's been getting a little more

[01:03:04] open since then um at least in the context of tech

[01:03:08] there's all sorts of pushback that's allowed now and like I said earlier a lot

[01:03:12] of this stuff is not even allowed in in uh in

[01:03:15] inside of your workplace um a lot of these conversations are not

[01:03:19] able to happen and probably there's something about

[01:03:23] the um ignoring the China Challenge

[01:03:27] has also gotten a lot harder there's probably you know there probably is close

[01:03:31] to bipartisan consensus that you need to do something I think there's sort of a lot of other

[01:03:35] countries that have you know are coming around to the U.S

[01:03:38] us view on this and um you know there

[01:03:42] obviously are still all these you know all these people in

[01:03:46] our society that have benefited you know this Hollywood the universities uh

[01:03:50] Wall Street so there are these institutions that somehow were um

[01:03:54] were long the the uh bilateral uh

[01:03:58] thing with China they were some long these pipelines but um but

[01:04:01] they they all feel like they're on the losing side it's sort

[01:04:05] of you know the the decoupling the

[01:04:09] um de-risking that train is leaving or has left the station

[01:04:12] and it's not a good idea not even in your economic self-interest

[01:04:16] to be you know just picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer that's sort of

[01:04:20] what you're doing and this is this is where you know I don't know just to pick on uh the

[01:04:24] um the Sequoia venture Capital firm would be me it seems to like a very

[01:04:28] clear calculation that okay this Train's leaving the station

[01:04:32] getting rid of the China just decoupling the radical decoupling the

[01:04:35] radicals spinning off all the different all the different funds

[01:04:39] and then you know we're sort of in this world where if you track it relative

[01:04:43] to statements they were making um you

[01:04:46] know op-eds that Mike Moritz was writing in the financial times three four years

[01:04:50] ago it's it's wow it's it's hard it's hard they

[01:04:54] sound like they were 100 years ago so we are in this I mean they

[01:04:57] for sure but then we are in this moment that's diverging

[01:05:02] from the previous five years six year seven years Trend

[01:05:05] I never thought that this stuff would come back the way that it did

[01:05:10] um I didn't even really have a sense of it in the early 90s at all do

[01:05:14] you agree that it's a kind of less distracted moment

[01:05:18] and then I guess the next question is like if this

[01:05:21] is just a Dei winter what does it look like when it returns I think people are aware

[01:05:25] of the science stagnation the way they were not 10 years ago I think they're aware

[01:05:29] of the economic stagnation the college thing and so and so all

[01:05:32] these things the kicking the can down the road doesn't

[01:05:36] doesn't work as well anymore I think the China thing they're they're aware

[01:05:40] of you know I think even even the the Christianity

[01:05:44] pieces you know it's somehow you

[01:05:47] know it is it is something to say that's

[01:05:51] um anti-ji Jinping thought you know the the new atheists I

[01:05:54] always think in the in the in the mid 2000s you know new atheism

[01:05:58] was just a it was a politically correct way to be anti-muslim and um and

[01:06:02] it seemed very desirable in some ways at the time

[01:06:05] and um whereas uh if you fast forward it

[01:06:09] to 20 you know 23 I am not I don't I'm not

[01:06:13] scared of Islam I'm not I don't even feel anything that

[01:06:17] bad about Islam anymore it's clear the enemy is um is

[01:06:20] is um ji's totalitarian China it's atheist

[01:06:24] and uh you know the East Bay rationalists have lost their way because

[01:06:28] they had a lot to say about Islamic fundamentalism they have

[01:06:32] nothing to say about the group think that is Xi Jinping thought I

[01:06:36] feel like we should end on something positive and I don't know what that

[01:06:40] could possibly be after this sort of like horrifying Specter of Communism well

[01:06:44] if you know if we there are a lot of reasons the

[01:06:47] the uh Tech stuff didn't happen if people were scared of the military

[01:06:52] um it was hard to come up with new ideas people were too risk-averse

[01:06:56] um but there was also there's also just a lot of Regulation and we we

[01:07:00] just wanted to hamstring it and and stop it

[01:07:04] if you look at the large language model breakthrough on with

[01:07:08] AI that seems like a big deal it's a it's a big thing

[01:07:11] that's happened it's hard to know all what it means it's disorienting

[01:07:15] all these ways but my my hopeful model is that is

[01:07:20] um there's going to be way less pushback on

[01:07:23] it than um than there was say on the big consumer internet companies

[01:07:27] and uh even though you know

[01:07:31] um the AI might be dangerous it might be disruptive or destructive

[01:07:35] to to various jobs um the thing it's going

[01:07:39] against is so exhausted and the thought experiment I sort of have is you have

[01:07:43] let's say you have a politically correct English PhD

[01:07:46] person who at the end of her PhD is

[01:07:50] in a dead-end job working as a barista at Starbucks

[01:07:54] and um and now is being told that the AI

[01:07:58] is going to disrupt everything and

[01:08:01] then do you fight the AI or do you fight to

[01:08:05] preserve your dead-end job and I think I think there's

[01:08:09] no energy left to fight the AI and so we're sort of in a moment where willingness

[01:08:12] the the by the the woke

[01:08:18] left whatever you want to call it to fight the future I think is

[01:08:21] much weaker you know you don't need a Manhattan project for AI you don't need

[01:08:25] a government project you don't need the universities to do it it's just happening

[01:08:28] and all you need to do is for it not to be stopped and if it doesn't

[01:08:32] stop the future will happen and I think that's the moment we're

[01:08:36] in
