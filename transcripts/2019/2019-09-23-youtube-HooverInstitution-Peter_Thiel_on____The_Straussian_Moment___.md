[Peter Thiel on “The Straussian Moment”](https://youtu.be/iRleB034EC8)

[00:00:00] [Music]

[00:00:07] welcome to uncommon knowledge I'm Peter Robinson born

[00:00:10] and Germany Peter teal moved to the United States with his family when he was a child he

[00:00:15] graduated from Stanford and then from Stanford Law School and after

[00:00:19] deciding not to practice law he co-founded PayPal and

[00:00:23] Palantir made the first outside investment in Facebook funded

[00:00:27] companies such as SpaceX and LinkedIn and started the teal fellowship

[00:00:31] which encourages young people to drop out of college to

[00:00:35] start their own businesses mr. teal remains a very active tech

[00:00:39] investor now based in Los Angeles Peter welcome thanks

[00:00:43] for having the show we'll come to

[00:00:46] tech and politics and all the matters of current affairs in

[00:00:50] which you're involved in a moment first the

[00:00:54] deep the substrate of your thinking in

[00:00:58] an essay you wrote in the early 2000s you talk about an

[00:01:02] impasse and you write about the Enlightenment tradition

[00:01:06] which we in the United States have inherited as a kind of treaty

[00:01:09] or settlement after decades of religious warfare in

[00:01:13] Europe quoting you the Enlightenment undertook

[00:01:17] a major strategic retreat if the

[00:01:21] only way to stop people from killing one another about religious questions involved

[00:01:25] a world where nobody thought about it too much then the intellectual

[00:01:28] cost of ceasing such thought seemed a small price

[00:01:32] to pay the question of human nature

[00:01:36] was abandoned close quote

[00:01:41] you're famous as a contrarian there could be almost nothing more

[00:01:44] contrarian than saying that the Enlightenment represented a retreat explain

[00:01:49] yourself well well if you want to use atomistic

[00:01:52] category you can distinguish the the intellect

[00:01:56] in the will on the medievals believed in the weakness of the

[00:02:00] will but in the power of the intellect and moderns

[00:02:04] tend to believe in the power of the will but the weakness of

[00:02:07] the intellect and so yeah I use a slightly different metaphor

[00:02:12] if you have an evangelical Christian I will study the outward-facing

[00:02:16] thing is that people are moral and that they're good Christians

[00:02:19] the inward-facing thing is that you're sinful and if you say well I mean this Bible

[00:02:23] study not figured out that I'm I'm a really good person you somehow not quite

[00:02:27] gotten the message now if we transpose this to a

[00:02:31] modern rationalist meetup the outward facing

[00:02:34] thing of modern rationalism is that you're more rational

[00:02:38] better able to think through things than other people you're one of the brights

[00:02:42] as I think Dawkins liked like to put

[00:02:45] it the inward facing thing is that you're not capable of thought that

[00:02:49] that it's basically your mind is full of spaghetti

[00:02:53] code you can't believe how bad people are thinking through things and

[00:02:56] that's I think the the scenic went on of

[00:03:00] sort of enlightenment rationality at this point and

[00:03:04] we see in all sorts of forms we do not we

[00:03:08] do not trust people's ability to think through things at all anymore

[00:03:11] in the 21st century I think it's a cultural aside one could say

[00:03:15] that the the mania we have around artificial intelligence is because

[00:03:18] it stands for the proposition that humans aren't supposed to think we

[00:03:22] want the machines to do the thinking but it's because we're in a world where individuals

[00:03:26] are not supposed to have intellectual agency of any sort

[00:03:30] anymore we don't trust rationality we can maybe believe in

[00:03:34] the wisdom of crowds we can believe in you know in big data and

[00:03:37] big data we can believe in in some sort of mechanistic process but

[00:03:41] we don't believe in the mind all right you continue

[00:03:45] in your essay to write about the German legal scholar Karl Schmitt mmm

[00:03:48] Karl Schmitt has a checkered record we better state that but that's

[00:03:52] not what you're talking about here you're talking about a particular point he makes it

[00:03:56] offers I'm quoting you again Schmitt offers an alternative to all the thinkers

[00:03:59] of the Enlightenment he concedes that there will never be any

[00:04:03] agreement on the most important things on questions of religion and virtue in the

[00:04:06] nature of humanity but Schmitt responds that it is a part of the human

[00:04:10] condition to be divided by such questions and to

[00:04:13] take sides politics is the field of

[00:04:17] battle in which that division takes place in which humans

[00:04:21] are forced to choose between friends and enemies close

[00:04:25] quote so the well lived life the

[00:04:29] truly human life the fully human life requires

[00:04:33] politics and politics requires making

[00:04:37] choices and choosing sides right

[00:04:41] well that's pretty well that's putting words that's what Schmidt

[00:04:44] would say it's not necessarily what what I would say okay what I would say is that there

[00:04:49] is something about politics that's deeply adversarial

[00:04:53] that's almost you're reduce ibly adversarial if you listen to a political

[00:04:56] speech and this is the sense of I think Schmidt is right that

[00:05:00] if you listen to political speech the applause lines are never

[00:05:04] the positive ways the positive things are going to do the applause

[00:05:08] lines are always how we're going to fight the other side how we're going

[00:05:11] to unite against the other side how terrible they are and we're going to stop them and

[00:05:15] and that that is kind of this this dynamism

[00:05:20] of of politics and then as a as

[00:05:23] someone who who's generally libertarian I'm always very complicated

[00:05:27] I would like to live in a world that's less political where there's

[00:05:30] less politics but I would also like us to be honest about how

[00:05:34] terrible politics is I think I suspect we can't avoid it altogether but

[00:05:38] but it is it is it is a it's a it's not a it's

[00:05:42] not a nice it's not a nice thing okay so one

[00:05:46] more step in this piece of the of the impact it's like I think we should I

[00:05:49] think we should always resist these sort of naive use of politics the politics are

[00:05:53] just you know some sort of against some sort of mechanistic process where

[00:05:56] we take a poll and we all get to some you know syrupy

[00:06:00] answer that everyone can agree with and that's that's not what politics

[00:06:04] is about at all okay I'm continuing to quote you

[00:06:07] from your essay the world of entertainment represents the

[00:06:11] culmination of the shift away from politics the Enlightenment

[00:06:15] says well we've had all these years of warfare over religion

[00:06:18] we'll stop asking important questions and all these decades these centuries

[00:06:22] after the Enlightenment here's the world we've reached this is the way I read you you

[00:06:26] can correct my reading but let me finish quoting you instead of violent wars

[00:06:29] there could be violent video games instead of heroic

[00:06:33] feats there could be thrilling amusement park rides instead

[00:06:37] of serious thought there could be intrigues of all sorts in

[00:06:40] a soap opera it is a world where people spend

[00:06:44] their lives amusing themselves to death close

[00:06:48] quote now that is a devastating indictment of

[00:06:52] much of contemporary America correct

[00:06:56] well it is I mean I think this has been the

[00:06:59] trend of modernity now it's it's it's not as though politics

[00:07:03] has disappeared though it's it's often just gets displaced in various ways

[00:07:07] but but yes I think there is this this incredible

[00:07:11] degree to which we've we've we've substituted

[00:07:16] the realities of politics for these sort of increasingly

[00:07:20] fictionalized worlds and and it's probably

[00:07:24] uh that's probably a very very unhealthy thing there's sort of a slightly

[00:07:27] different frame that I've often given on this is is that

[00:07:31] in in the last 40 or 50 years there's

[00:07:35] been a shift from exteriority which I which

[00:07:39] you know doing things in the real world to

[00:07:43] the sort of interior world which is sort of in a way can be thought of

[00:07:46] this also the shift from politics to entertainment

[00:07:50] or something like that and and the the from

[00:07:54] a dr. Phil a the powerful frame I give is you know

[00:07:58] almost exactly 50 years ago today and you know July of 1969

[00:08:02] men reached the moon and three weeks later Woodstock

[00:08:06] began and with the benefit of hindsight we can say that that's when

[00:08:10] you know progress ended and when the hippies took over the country or

[00:08:13] something like that and then we've had we've had this incredible

[00:08:17] shift to interior tea in the decades since then I would include

[00:08:21] things like the drug counterculture I would include videogames

[00:08:25] you know maybe a lot of entertainment more generally you

[00:08:29] know there's sort of parts of the internet that can be scored both

[00:08:33] ways but but certainly there all these things where we've

[00:08:37] shifted towards the you know your world of yoga meditation there's

[00:08:41] a world of interior culture that sort of and it

[00:08:45] just sort of super inward facing all right or if you want to if you want to frame it theologically

[00:08:49] you could say it's a it's like it's always the

[00:08:53] I always like the quote from Milton and Paradise Lost where the

[00:08:57] mind is its own place and of itself can make a hell

[00:09:00] of heaven and a heaven of hell and this is what you're supposed

[00:09:04] to be skeptical that that's what Satan says when he gets um get sent

[00:09:08] to hell my says well just my mind if I just changed my mind you know right

[00:09:12] I can change where I am and that's not quite true you

[00:09:15] know there's an external reality but but somehow

[00:09:19] the temptation to turn everything into something therapeutic

[00:09:23] something psychological meditative has been

[00:09:26] a very powerful one in in the in the post 1960s

[00:09:30] America okay this is fascinating although

[00:09:33] I should I should just stipulate it's it's going to be frustrating because these

[00:09:37] are deep thoughts and you've read and written and Carl

[00:09:41] Schmitt is a major and here we are reducing it ox to the size of a bullion cube

[00:09:44] but that's television and now I'm about to do it all over again because from Carl

[00:09:48] Schmitt to someone who is one of your favorite thinkers and was a friend of

[00:09:52] of ours we both knew this man until

[00:09:56] his death a few years ago Rene Girard Rene

[00:09:59] Girard is difficult to summarize but a central aspect of

[00:10:03] his thinking is the so-called scapegoating mechanism in primitive

[00:10:07] societies conflict was often resolved by sacrificing a

[00:10:11] single individual or scapegoat whose death would reunite

[00:10:15] would calm he'll reunite the community we see murders

[00:10:18] like this in myth and sacrificial practices

[00:10:22] in the classical world so forth okay once

[00:10:26] again Peter teal for Gerard there remains a denial

[00:10:30] of the founding role of violence caused by human mammy

[00:10:33] so that is the human desire to imitate each other which is the source of a great

[00:10:37] deal of trouble in his thinking and therefore a systematic

[00:10:41] underestimation of the scope of apocalyptic violence

[00:10:46] what if mimesis are urged imitate

[00:10:49] each other drives others to acquire nuclear weapons for the sake of for the prestige

[00:10:53] they confer the world that best describes this unbounded

[00:10:57] apocalyptic violence is terrorism close quote there's

[00:11:00] a lot there but but Rene

[00:11:04] Girard is in some ways the addresses

[00:11:08] an aspect of human nature well it's it's

[00:11:12] good it's the very thing that the Enlightenment says

[00:11:16] no no don't even think about such things right yeah well the Enlightenment always

[00:11:19] whitewashes violence it's one of the there are

[00:11:23] many things we can't think about an under Enlightenment reason but one one is certainly

[00:11:26] violence itself and and if you go to the anthropological myth

[00:11:30] of the Enlightenment it's the myth of the social contract so what happens

[00:11:34] when everybody is that everybody's else's throat what the Enlightenment

[00:11:38] says is everybody in the middle of the crisis sits down and has

[00:11:42] a nice legal chat and draws up a social contract and that's maybe

[00:11:46] maybe that's the founding myth the central lie of the

[00:11:49] Enlightenment if you will and what Gerrard says something very different must

[00:11:53] have happened and when everybody's at everybody's throat the violence doesn't just

[00:11:57] resolve itself and maybe it gets channeled against

[00:12:01] a a specific scapegoat where the war of all against all

[00:12:04] becomes a war can of all against one and then somehow gets

[00:12:08] resolved but in a in a very violent way and so

[00:12:12] I think you know what what Gerrard and Schmidt or Machiavelli

[00:12:16] or you know the judeo-christian inspiration

[00:12:19] all have in common is this idea that human nature is problematic

[00:12:23] its violent it's um you know it's it's it's it's it's it's

[00:12:27] not straightforward at all what what you do with this on it's not sort

[00:12:31] of simply utopian or where we can say that everybody's

[00:12:34] not fundamentally good where someone like Gerard and Schmidt very

[00:12:38] much disagree is that Gerard believes

[00:12:42] that once you describe this it has this dissolving effect

[00:12:46] so scapegoating violence only works if

[00:12:50] you don't understand what you're doing and so if we say well we

[00:12:53] have we have a crisis in our village and we're gonna have a witch-hunt so

[00:12:57] that everybody can you know get out all their negative energy and you know will

[00:13:01] target this one elderly woman that only works

[00:13:05] if you don't think of it as a fake psychosocial thing right

[00:13:08] once you think of it in those terms it stops to work and so there's sort of a

[00:13:12] there is the sense of late modernity where this unraveling

[00:13:16] has been for Gerard an ambiguous thing it's both

[00:13:19] it's both a bad thing because they're these cultural institutions that

[00:13:23] were the only way we had ever had of working and they're there unraveling

[00:13:27] but it's also inevitable we can't somehow put the genie

[00:13:30] back into the bottle and and so the the

[00:13:34] Rorion critique of schmidt would be that

[00:13:38] that somehow when Schmidt says politics is about friends and

[00:13:41] enemies he's being so explicit Schmidt thinks by being

[00:13:45] explicitly that he's strengthening politics but maybe it has this effect

[00:13:48] of of undermining it and and this is I think you

[00:13:52] know there are elements of this that one sees in you know in the contemporary

[00:13:55] scene in the US where that you know there's something about it that's super

[00:13:59] intense but then also you know is super fake at the same

[00:14:03] time that's that's sort of what what what people would people what

[00:14:07] people see and and and it doesn't quite work when it's going to simply fake

[00:14:10] Peter Thiel I'm quoting you again we are at an impasse

[00:14:14] on the one hand we have the newer project of the Enlightenment

[00:14:18] which perhaps always came at too high a price of self

[00:14:22] stultify Haitian again the Enlightenment looks

[00:14:26] at three centuries of religious warfare in Europe and says we can just we'll

[00:14:29] just rule those questions out of order stop asking

[00:14:33] them and Peter teal and Carl Schmitt say yes

[00:14:36] but that leads to a narrow small life

[00:14:40] okay on the other hand we have a return to the

[00:14:44] older tradition now elsewhere in your essay you're talking about

[00:14:48] terrorism in the third world and Islamic

[00:14:52] radicalism we have a return to the older tradition but

[00:14:55] that return is fraught with far too much violence

[00:15:00] that is to say places in the world where they are asking the first

[00:15:03] about first thing by first principles human nature the

[00:15:07] nature of God there seems to be violence involved and

[00:15:12] so we're at an impasse now

[00:15:17] soluble or insoluble well it's always easier to describe problems

[00:15:21] than to solve them this is this this is a certainly a case in point so

[00:15:25] yeah so the impasse if you frame this in more scientific

[00:15:29] or technological terms the impasse is that the weapons

[00:15:33] have the technologies such that you know we could probably destroy

[00:15:36] the world many times over and there's some point at which this

[00:15:40] sort of breaks down you know maybe World War one didn't make that much sense people

[00:15:44] still thought it made sense pre-world War one they still thought there was

[00:15:47] such a thing as a winnable war debatable in the cases

[00:15:51] of World War one and World War two but certainly you

[00:15:55] know by by the time you get to say 1970 and you have enough nuclear weapons

[00:15:59] to destroy the world 20 times over it just

[00:16:02] doesn't make any sense anymore and and I think one you

[00:16:06] know I've spoken a lot in different contexts about the sort of technology

[00:16:10] stagnation yes we've come to the last 50 years

[00:16:13] but but sort of one way to relate the tech stagnation to

[00:16:17] this theme is that is that it was just

[00:16:21] not motivated anymore you know if you can think of the Manhattan Project the Apollo

[00:16:24] space program were had military motivation

[00:16:28] maybe the space program ended in 1975 when we

[00:16:32] had the Apollo Soyuz docking we're just gonna be friends why do you have to work 80 hours a

[00:16:35] week you know around the clock and and

[00:16:39] there is a certain sense in which I would like to see us

[00:16:42] accelerate technological and scientific innovation

[00:16:46] on back to you know the rate at which these things were progressing the

[00:16:49] first half of the 20th century but you can't motivate it

[00:16:53] by building you know more advanced weapon systems

[00:16:57] and and then it's not clear we found a substitute for that okay

[00:17:01] now you taught a course here at Stanford I'm not I'm

[00:17:04] sticking with the impasse for a moment because you taught of course here at Stanford last

[00:17:08] year and I have a couple of undergraduate friends who took notes and slipped

[00:17:12] me their notes and and then I looked over

[00:17:15] the syllabus there's one one reading that

[00:17:19] you gave the kids that fascinates me I'm

[00:17:23] not sure you presented it quite this way but it almost seems as though there's

[00:17:27] an underlying suggestion that it's the way out

[00:17:31] of the impasse or it's an a way out of the impasse now

[00:17:35] yet my hopes are high Peter don't if you -

[00:17:39] them just let me down gently would you please so here's

[00:17:43] the tech you used the 2006 address

[00:17:46] at Regensburg by pope benedict xvi not the

[00:17:50] current pontiff his predecessor the theologian

[00:17:53] the shy theologian benedict xvi the pope

[00:17:57] again this takes a little moment or two to set up but i'm just set it up and then get out of the

[00:18:01] way and let's see what you do with it he makes a couple of assertions the first

[00:18:04] concerns the reasonableness of religious belief and

[00:18:08] he quotes an exchange between a 14th century Byzantine Emperor

[00:18:11] and his Muslim captors in which the emperor tells them

[00:18:15] they're wrong to impose religion by force

[00:18:19] benedict xvi in the speech he

[00:18:23] asks is the conviction that acting unreasonably contradicts

[00:18:27] god's nature merely a greek idea or is

[00:18:31] it always and intrinsically true

[00:18:34] modifying the first book of Genesis the first book of the whole Bible John

[00:18:38] the Apostle John begins the prologue of his gospel with the words

[00:18:42] in the beginning was the logos John thus

[00:18:45] Spoke the final word on the biblical concept of God and in

[00:18:49] this word all the often tortuous threads of biblical faith find

[00:18:53] their culmination and synthesis close quote alright huge

[00:18:57] amount there but the fundamental idea is that

[00:19:00] properly understood faith is

[00:19:04] reasonable it's not merely the idea of

[00:19:08] the reasonableness of faith is not merely a cultural construct

[00:19:12] that belief belongs in one place or one time it is intrinsically

[00:19:16] faith is intrinsically reasonable the Enlightenment got

[00:19:19] that wrong and we we need some how or other

[00:19:23] to reown to grasp the reasonableness of the

[00:19:27] first questions that will enable us to ask them once again right

[00:19:31] well this is there's a lot that we could one could I'm just gonna

[00:19:35] let you take a look at what can unpack in all of this I I would

[00:19:39] say the Sun though isn't it it's is wow this is like this is a harder interview

[00:19:43] that I was expecting way harder than I was expecting uh I think

[00:19:46] that I think it is a little bit tricky to say both

[00:19:50] that it's you don't want faith to be unreasonable you don't want it to be

[00:19:54] merely reasonable because then you could just use reason and

[00:19:58] so it's always a little bit of a complicated question of how how

[00:20:01] you get faith Nathan and reason to work

[00:20:05] together the I'm naturally quite sympathetic to

[00:20:09] to the Benedict position

[00:20:13] position right an approach in a lot of ways and yet the

[00:20:17] from a literary point of view what was so interesting about reading

[00:20:21] the Regensburg address where it was you know who's maybe using this

[00:20:24] 14th century Byzantine Emperor maybe as a mouthpiece for the pro

[00:20:28] reason thing we know what happened to the Byzantine Empire it sort of fell

[00:20:32] apart shortly thereafter ashore and the suspicion one

[00:20:36] has is maybe the Byzantine Emperor in the 14th century should

[00:20:39] not just have been making reasoned arguments but should have also been getting

[00:20:43] some weapons and protecting himself from what

[00:20:47] was on you know the disaster that was about to befall the Byzantine Empire

[00:20:50] and and then the the thought

[00:20:54] I had in looking at the speech from the point of view of 2019

[00:20:58] that I wonder about is was there something about it that was somehow

[00:21:01] prophetic of something going wrong with sort

[00:21:05] of rationalist conservative Catholicism where you

[00:21:09] know Benedict is just like the 14th century Byzantine

[00:21:13] Emperor and maybe even I'm pro reason and I

[00:21:17] think we live in a society where people don't respect reason enough he somehow

[00:21:20] believed in it too much and and and

[00:21:24] then you know my I'm not not Catholic like like you and I I've

[00:21:28] always I always have a two-word rebuttal of Roman Catholicism to all

[00:21:31] my conservative Catholic friends it's just uh Pope Francis and

[00:21:36] and there were there was something about you get

[00:21:40] to say that now if I start on those I just add 10,000 years just to my time in purgatory

[00:21:43] just have you back on your show yeah exactly okay okay so that's that's

[00:21:47] that's the so it's it's it's a it's a fascinating speech

[00:21:50] but so you act on all these levels so I read the

[00:21:54] RET Regensburg address in your syllabus and I thought ah Peters offering

[00:21:58] here's the way out of the impasse and you're saying no not exactly I

[00:22:01] take that as a warning to

[00:22:05] place too much faith place too much faith in the reasonableness

[00:22:09] of faith or unreasonableness itself and ten

[00:22:13] years later everything you stood for will be wiped out well I think look

[00:22:17] I think I think we have to always try to go back to

[00:22:22] intellect mind rationality as as core

[00:22:25] values and there are there are ways in which we've we've gone

[00:22:29] too far from them but at the same time I also think there's

[00:22:33] something be said for it can't be just in Terry or T we also should be you

[00:22:37] know acting in our world we should be we should be you

[00:22:41] know we shouldn't be in this sort of yoga meditative psychological

[00:22:45] retreat and and that's the that's MN and then

[00:22:49] there are and then there's sort of all these ways where science and

[00:22:52] technology you know that the were the

[00:22:56] sort of the that there was such a big driver of progress for

[00:23:00] centuries there's so many parts of these that no longer feel

[00:23:03] positive to people okay and that that feel like a retreat I'll give a I'll

[00:23:07] give a Silicon Valley version of this you know I was I was involved in the early

[00:23:10] 2000s and a lot of the futuristic AI

[00:23:14] initiatives you invested in there's a singularity

[00:23:17] Institute that we're sort of all these groups and right the basic premise was you know AI is

[00:23:21] gonna happen it's gonna be if it happens it's this barium hold

[00:23:24] on you better just for viewers you better explain give us a two-sentence definition

[00:23:28] of it yeah it means all these different things but the the context in which they used it was sort of

[00:23:32] the science fiction version of AI so SuperDuper smart computers

[00:23:36] that can do anything and they're gonna be very powerful so sad they'll seem like

[00:23:39] humans and or maybe even smarter than humans and it's very important

[00:23:43] whether or not they're friendly or unfriendly and this was sort of an important problem that we

[00:23:47] needed to solving and circa 2003 it felt like

[00:23:51] okay we don't know which way it's going to go and we need to

[00:23:54] to work on it and if you had a score it circuit 2019

[00:23:59] it's um it's far more pessimistic and people

[00:24:02] now believe they know what's going to happen at the singularity that Dai is

[00:24:06] going to kill every human being on this planet that's what people actually believe and

[00:24:10] including you well I'm we

[00:24:14] can be skeptical how fast it happens you know but no

[00:24:17] that's the that's the general zeitgeist even in Staten Valley okay

[00:24:21] Vanessa talking about it certainly anyone who watches a science fiction movie believes

[00:24:25] that and your point is that this value which used to be

[00:24:28] bright and hopeful has gone very dark and so maybe for an AI researcher

[00:24:32] you should be working on it very very slowly and you're gonna be somewhat less motivated

[00:24:36] to work on it and it has a very different has a very

[00:24:40] different sort of a sort of a feel to it and so even even this

[00:24:43] sort of fairly theoretical part of computer

[00:24:47] science it's more in the world of bits than the world of atoms has

[00:24:51] has shifted into this much more apocalyptic direction

[00:24:55] where you know the we're you know 2003 2004

[00:24:59] it was we need to move as fast as we can and now it's

[00:25:02] it's sort of like the precautionary principle and maybe you know we should be scared

[00:25:06] of her own shadow and just be very very slow and that's

[00:25:10] happened even in even in computer science this is one of

[00:25:13] the healthier fields still twenty years ago all right

[00:25:19] contemporary politics the issues of the day China

[00:25:23] what went wrong let me be a simple

[00:25:27] quotation here the late economist and foreign policy analyst my colleague

[00:25:31] here at the Hoover Institution Harry Rowan Harry Rowan by the way was a lovely

[00:25:34] humane highly intelligent man I say that because I'm about

[00:25:38] to make a read a quotation from him that suggests he was just

[00:25:42] mistaken he wasn't always mistaken he wrote this in 1996

[00:25:46] when will China become a democracy the answer is around the Year 2015

[00:25:50] this prediction is based on China's steady and impressive economic growth

[00:25:54] which in turn fits the pattern of the way in which freedom has grown

[00:25:58] in Asia and elsewhere in the world close quote economic

[00:26:02] growth was supposed to lead to democracy in China and that wasn't madness

[00:26:06] there was the example of South Korea first they got rich

[00:26:11] and then they became democratic and of Taiwan they

[00:26:14] got rich and then they became democratic and you

[00:26:18] could argue that the American foreign

[00:26:22] policy establishment has lost a quarter of a century expecting

[00:26:26] things to go right in China and they haven't how come

[00:26:29] well I think these you know these things are

[00:26:33] are always some would over to determine but maybe maybe if I had to come up

[00:26:37] with a simple mistake that people made was it

[00:26:41] was way too deterministic a view of history there's nothing automatic about

[00:26:45] the way history can happen and it's

[00:26:48] it's it's not that you get to you know $8,000 per capita

[00:26:52] GDP and you automatically become a democracy these

[00:26:56] things can go go in a lot of different directions there's there's a great

[00:26:59] deal of contingency and if I had to pick on you a little bit Peter

[00:27:03] here it would be that you know there's the that speech that you helped ghostwriter

[00:27:07] right tear down that wall mr. Gorbachev yes yes

[00:27:11] and and it was effective and

[00:27:14] the Berlin Wall came down in 89 and communism

[00:27:19] fell in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union stop there but

[00:27:23] we can't stop there because because there

[00:27:27] were other people who paid attention to this and there are people in China and East Asia who

[00:27:31] paid attention to this and they drew some very different lessons

[00:27:35] and the lesson they drew was that we have to make

[00:27:39] sure that we keep the Leninist part of the state running

[00:27:43] very strongly we can have you

[00:27:46] know you can have perestroika you can have restructuring

[00:27:50] but you can't have glasnost and we're going to decouple them and we're gonna learn

[00:27:54] the opposite lesson because yeah you open things up just a

[00:27:58] little bit too much and things fall apart and then and I

[00:28:01] think yeah I think for you know 28 years it's

[00:28:05] at least 89 to 2017 we

[00:28:08] basically in the West read the events of 89 is that was inevitably

[00:28:12] going to happen in the east mhm and China read them it's not gonna happen because we'll

[00:28:16] learn we're gonna learn from history we're gonna make sure it doesn't happen here and the

[00:28:20] exact same events were interpreted in in different

[00:28:24] ways and they were probably not going to happen because China wasn't going to let them

[00:28:27] and we were oblivious to this because we were just so convinced

[00:28:31] of this determinacy of history right that you know the Rif I always

[00:28:34] have on this is that 2017-2018

[00:28:38] is the year that G became president for life and that's the

[00:28:42] year that fukuyama's end of history definitively came to an end

[00:28:46] but you know there are all these reasons you could have said you know right it was there

[00:28:49] was a lot of evidence earlier that things were off okay

[00:28:53] in your book zero - I'm quoting all kinds of at least I

[00:28:57] get high marks for doing my homework the quotes are accurate okay in your book

[00:29:00] zero to one quote China is the paradigmatic example of globalization

[00:29:04] its 20-year plan is to become like the United States is today close quote

[00:29:08] so China this is this is another I think

[00:29:12] dated thought but I'll let you tell me China can only copy it

[00:29:15] is incapable of genuine innovation on its own

[00:29:19] and as long as the United States remains innovative then

[00:29:23] we have the hope of remaining a step or two ahead of them yes

[00:29:29] yes I agree with that but I would read

[00:29:32] it a little bit differently so I think I I do think that the

[00:29:36] West is still far more innovative than than

[00:29:40] China but if you're only one or

[00:29:43] two steps ahead that's not very much and so if things are copied

[00:29:47] very quickly then maybe you don't need to innovate at all you

[00:29:51] can outsource all the very hard R&D work to

[00:29:55] to the West you have a lot of deadweight economic

[00:29:59] costs associated with that and then if you can just steal all the IP it

[00:30:02] might that might even be you know a more efficient way to to

[00:30:06] innovate here maybe you're six months behind but you don't

[00:30:10] be behind that far and so I think that's I think that's roughly

[00:30:14] the way to think of a lot of the contemporary

[00:30:18] sort of technology racist you know you

[00:30:22] know if there's innovation happening in AI and I think most

[00:30:25] of the breakthroughs or just about all the breakthroughs I believe have happened

[00:30:29] in the West but they they get transmitted to China within

[00:30:32] six to twelve months and so that's that's that's not another

[00:30:36] one origin for us so we yes we're innovating but it only gives you

[00:30:39] so much now you have said actually this is something else I have

[00:30:43] in here but I'm not going to take the time to go back and find it that one of the six all

[00:30:47] paraphrase you said one of the signal accomplishments of the Trump

[00:30:50] administration is causing everybody to rethink

[00:30:54] to reevaluate China how

[00:30:58] is so Trump we've got a number

[00:31:01] of different what's getting all the attention is the trade policy slapping on tariffs

[00:31:06] The Wall Street Journal takes one whack at him after another's arguing that

[00:31:09] we're harming our sabab zelich in the journal this morning was arguing we're

[00:31:13] doing far more harm to ourselves and our own trading partners than we are to China then

[00:31:17] you've also got I believe you'd know more about this than I but I believe

[00:31:21] there are also stepped-up intelligence efforts and stepped-up enforcement

[00:31:25] efforts concerning technology

[00:31:28] transfers just a sort of open-ended

[00:31:32] question how is the Trump administration doing

[00:31:36] in terms not just of waking everyone up to the danger of

[00:31:39] China but the actual implementation of specific policy well

[00:31:43] I think I think this is all still very much a work in progress right I

[00:31:47] think that there has been a sea change on the

[00:31:51] on the perception with China and in a way the way I think

[00:31:55] of US politics is it's yet sadly tribal it's too

[00:31:59] polarized most the times we just have this trench warfare with the two

[00:32:02] parties fighting each other no one makes much progress it's when you

[00:32:06] really win on issues when you get the other side to agree with you and

[00:32:09] I believe that on the China issue the Trump administration has

[00:32:13] gotten the entire center left to left to

[00:32:17] agree with him I think maybe maybe Biden is still the

[00:32:21] one Pro China candidate running

[00:32:24] and that that seems like a catastrophic albatross for him in the Democratic

[00:32:28] primary this year I think all the others are are

[00:32:32] probably as anti China or it's tough on China as

[00:32:36] as the president is maybe they'll be even tougher if they get in

[00:32:40] because to some extent the Trump administration policies

[00:32:43] are still moderated by we're trying not to hurt American businesses

[00:32:47] and I suspect the the Democrats will be less concerned about about

[00:32:51] business got it but but I think I think there's been a there's been a

[00:32:54] sea change a sea change on that yes

[00:32:58] and of course the free trade theories are correct in theory there

[00:33:02] are all sorts of but in in the real world the stuff is

[00:33:05] always super messy and if you're negotiating a free

[00:33:09] trade treaty you want the person negotiating it to be one who's not a deck

[00:33:13] doctrinaire free trader because the doctrinaire free trader will

[00:33:16] believe that the worse a job that you go shading the

[00:33:20] better a job they're doing because if you you know even if even

[00:33:24] if you you concede everything and you get nothing from the other side there

[00:33:28] still are these gains from trade and that's what free trade doctrine always

[00:33:32] tells you that you don't need to work very hard on these trade treaties and

[00:33:36] the u.s. is really the only country in the world that that believe

[00:33:40] that you know you know Western Europe Japan

[00:33:44] have in effect far higher you know they've

[00:33:48] got barriers to trade you have you have tariffs in the

[00:33:51] form of VAT taxes you know different it's right percent

[00:33:55] or across the board on goods in Western Europe Japan and

[00:33:59] and you know it's there's a there's a yes

[00:34:03] if we got rid of all that maybe that would be a sort of more efficient world but

[00:34:06] we've obviously gotten to a very very unbalanced point you know the other the

[00:34:10] other metaphor I always give on this is that you know the basic

[00:34:14] flow is we have you know five hundred billion dollars that we import from China one

[00:34:17] hundred billion a year that we export to China and in effect four hundred

[00:34:21] billion dollars of cash flows uphill from being

[00:34:25] saved by poor Chinese peasants and being invested in low yielding

[00:34:29] US government bonds and so if you're looking at this from outer space that

[00:34:32] alone tells you that it's just it's just a

[00:34:36] completely crazy regime but that's some what about well

[00:34:39] what if they want their peasants to finance our government

[00:34:43] debt why not well rightly type free-trade argument

[00:34:47] but if we believed in globalization yes the way globalization is supposed to work

[00:34:50] is the less developed countries are supposed to converge they

[00:34:54] converge they grow faster therefore you get a higher return on investing

[00:34:58] in them and therefore capital should be exported from the developed to

[00:35:02] the developing countries that is the direction which capital flowed

[00:35:06] circa 1900 right when the United Kingdom had a current

[00:35:10] account surplus a four percent of GDP and the extra capital was

[00:35:13] invested in Argentinian bonds and Russian railroads and all these

[00:35:17] different things and you know the globalization ended badly in 1914

[00:35:21] in the late 19th 20th century but that at least made sense yes

[00:35:24] the money flowed in the correct direction this time we're in a much crazier

[00:35:28] form where the money is flowing but the wrong

[00:35:32] way that's not what Chinese peasants shouldn't be saving money and low-yielding

[00:35:36] government US bonds or negatively yielding European bonds

[00:35:40] there should be a you know investing in China where they should be getting a higher return and

[00:35:44] so should we alright I want to come back to Trump in a moment but first

[00:35:48] it sort of a summary

[00:35:51] question about China population of 1.3 billion intense

[00:35:55] work ethic the ability to to deploy capital and infrastructure

[00:35:59] everybody says including you have told me this you go

[00:36:03] to China and the airports are dazzling and the trains run fast

[00:36:07] and they're clean and efficient and of

[00:36:10] course now they have a habit of rapid economic growth and in

[00:36:14] the long contest to come between the United States and China

[00:36:18] what if we got democracy a free press

[00:36:22] innovation that keeps us six months ahead are you optimistic

[00:36:26] well it's very hard to to score

[00:36:30] I I would say the my pessimists hoping

[00:36:33] you cheer me up about this my my neutrally pessimistic description

[00:36:37] is is that you know if you scored

[00:36:41] it I think both sides think they're going to lose I think the

[00:36:44] United States thinks that yeah it's it's sort of like this declining power but

[00:36:49] but China does not think it's going to win you know it's you

[00:36:52] have a demographic collapse right um you know anyone who

[00:36:56] makes money tries to get their capital out of the country people are still

[00:37:00] you know if at all possible trying to to get out

[00:37:03] of China and so so if you sort of if

[00:37:07] you were to try to you know psychologically score the two sides and

[00:37:10] say who believes they're going to win

[00:37:15] actually they both think they're going to lose and and I you know I even

[00:37:19] if you think you're going to win doesn't mean you're going to win although I think if you think it's better way to go to life

[00:37:22] that you think you're going to lose you will see anybody if you think you're going to be on a test don't

[00:37:26] always get an A if you think you're gonna get an F you always get enough right and and

[00:37:30] so so what's what's very confusing is I think I think

[00:37:34] both sides think they are they're going to lose I told a lie one

[00:37:37] more question about China you said a moment ago that in the 50s

[00:37:41] and 60s a lot of the technological progress was driven in effect by the Cold

[00:37:45] War by the neat the military need to

[00:37:49] develop technology which reminds me of again I

[00:37:52] can't quote this I can only paraphrase it but there's some place in fairly

[00:37:56] early George Kennan one of the diplomats and

[00:38:00] important writers in the Cold War fairly early George Kennan in which he

[00:38:04] wrote that he welcomed the long struggle to come between

[00:38:08] the United States and the Soviet Union because it would bring out the best in

[00:38:11] the United States we had nothing to fear from this as long as we

[00:38:15] lived up to our own best traditions he he expected

[00:38:19] it to be a bracing struggle struggle between

[00:38:23] China and the United States help us technologically will it be good for

[00:38:26] our character well the Cold War you know we

[00:38:30] won the Cold War but but there are a lot of modern ways

[00:38:33] that could have gone so I'm I'm not quite sure I'd rather not totally I'm not totally convinced

[00:38:37] of that but I think yeah I think I

[00:38:41] think that I think the future the future version

[00:38:44] of you know I do

[00:38:48] think that we we the future the China represents

[00:38:52] is not a future that is that is particularly desirable I was

[00:38:56] I was struck by this when I was in Western Europe a few

[00:39:00] months ago that I think I think the future is something that

[00:39:04] always has to be thought of in relatively concrete terms and

[00:39:07] it has to be different from the present and only something

[00:39:11] that's different from the present and very concrete can

[00:39:15] have any sort of charismatic force and and looking

[00:39:18] at Western Europe I would say there are they're basically three

[00:39:22] plausible futures on offer number

[00:39:26] one is on Islamic sharia law and if

[00:39:30] you're a woman you get to wear a burka number two

[00:39:34] is totalitarian ai

[00:39:37] Allah China where

[00:39:41] the computers track you in everything you do all

[00:39:45] the time and that's kind of creepy sort of the the Eye

[00:39:48] of Sauron he's the Lord of the Rings reference watching you at all times

[00:39:52] and then the third one is is hyper

[00:39:56] environmentalism where you drive a nice scooter and you you recycle

[00:40:01] and even though I'm not you know not a radical environmentalist I

[00:40:04] think if those are the three choices you can understand why the green

[00:40:08] movements winning because those are the three visions

[00:40:12] of the future we have right and and the challenge the

[00:40:16] challenge on the conservative or libertarian side is is

[00:40:19] to offer something that's that's a picture of the future that's

[00:40:23] different from from these these two very

[00:40:27] distant and one somewhat stagnant one okay

[00:40:31] a note from a friend of mine young friend of mine

[00:40:35] who took this is a note that he took in your class so this isn't in your

[00:40:38] syllabus it's something you said in class if you've got economic growth you can solve most

[00:40:42] problems this brings us to Donald Trump we've got economic

[00:40:45] growth now the 3% seems to have cooled as we sit here talking

[00:40:49] maybe it's going to average out this year is something between one

[00:40:53] point eight two point four something like that but it's economic growth maybe

[00:40:56] we all relax well Reagan we got 6%

[00:41:00] growth in 83 84 85 we got something like 6%

[00:41:04] growth almost three years in a row so so

[00:41:07] it's yep 2 or 3% is is definitely

[00:41:11] better than nothing the the the the

[00:41:15] question on the on the Trump administration is can we keep

[00:41:19] going with this for the next decade and and

[00:41:23] I think you know I think in some ways the president will get reelected

[00:41:27] if people believe that this sort of growth is going to

[00:41:30] be sustainable for for for the next decade that's the future he

[00:41:34] offers and that's it you know it's it's not quite as

[00:41:37] exciting as Reagan but it's still on you know to 23%

[00:41:41] for a decade we will graduate things will gradually get better

[00:41:44] we will work our way out of a lot out of a lot of these challenges

[00:41:48] and then and then the the concern is if it's if

[00:41:52] it's just this temporary blip driven by too much debt too

[00:41:56] much things like that then then Joe Biden

[00:42:00] or Elizabeth Sanders starts elizabeth warren's Elizabeth Sanders they might as well be Bernie

[00:42:04] were nor Elizabeth sander start to look ok socialists are right you

[00:42:08] know not to be underestimated I mean it's you know it's it's there's

[00:42:11] there's a there's a Marxist theory that that you know the marks

[00:42:15] the time for communism would come when interest rates went to zero because

[00:42:19] the zero percent interest rate was assigned the capitalists

[00:42:23] no longer had any idea what to do with their money and therefore there

[00:42:26] was they're no good investments left that's why the rates are zero and therefore

[00:42:30] all that you could do at that point was redistribute the capital and so I'm you

[00:42:33] know it's it doesn't means or percent rates lead us to socialism but

[00:42:37] it is always something that I find I find it alarming that the rates

[00:42:41] are as low as they are last question about Donald Trump do

[00:42:44] you expect to endorse him yes I mean I certainly

[00:42:48] will not endorse any of his any of his opponents all right a couple

[00:42:53] of closing questions here we became friends when you were still a student

[00:42:56] here at Stanford imagine imagine

[00:43:00] a young Peter teal listening to us now Peter teal

[00:43:04] himself Stanford undergraduate Stanford Law

[00:43:08] School practice law at a big fancy firm in New York for seven

[00:43:12] months and then said this is horrible came out here and began

[00:43:15] investing in tech but

[00:43:19] now Peter Thiel himself has the teal fellowships which are to entice really

[00:43:22] bright kids to drop out of college and you've just sat here telling

[00:43:26] us that the the the valley that you came

[00:43:30] back to from New York and began investing in is not the valley of

[00:43:33] today things have gone dark so what

[00:43:37] path would you recommend to an 18 or 20 year old

[00:43:40] now Wow you know it's these

[00:43:44] are always such hard questions to UM to answer

[00:43:48] and I think even if I knew all these things I'm

[00:43:52] not sure what I would have done of course that's a that's a fake thought

[00:43:55] experiment you know the question looking back would be when

[00:43:59] I graduated undergraduate in 1989 what what

[00:44:03] are some different choices I would have done and okay I think I should have

[00:44:07] the advice I would the reasonable advice I'd give my

[00:44:11] former self from thirty years ago would

[00:44:15] be something like just think a lot harder about the future

[00:44:18] don't think of education as a substitute for the

[00:44:22] you know try to think concretely what what you

[00:44:26] want to do and and and there's something about

[00:44:29] the sort of tracked educational

[00:44:33] system that again it gets packaged as a form of

[00:44:37] thought but it's a it's a substitute for thought it's a substitute

[00:44:40] for the future and and yeah you

[00:44:44] have to it's it's you probably don't want to do the things that are hyper

[00:44:48] competitive that you know that everybody's doing there's

[00:44:51] you know and I think there's always a question you know where's the frontier where

[00:44:55] there some pockets innovation where where you can do some some new things

[00:44:59] and not be and you know in a in

[00:45:02] a crazed competition that's that's that that was a hard question answer

[00:45:06] then I think it's a harder one now but I think it's still the right question to ask all right

[00:45:10] it's always money it's always the contrarian intellectual question tell me something that's

[00:45:14] true that yes yes yes this is your favorite question you know what what is what's

[00:45:17] a good career that other people aren't pursuing you

[00:45:22] know the politically the politically incorrect career engineering careers

[00:45:25] petroleum engineering so it's it's it's it's

[00:45:29] it's super lucrative and the just are um you know ideological

[00:45:33] reasons not enough people go into it alright let's that's a that's a straightforward ideological

[00:45:38] answer alright so here's the last question Peter you're

[00:45:42] still investing but you're teaching classes

[00:45:46] at Stanford you're fielding telephone calls from the White

[00:45:49] House at this stage in your life what

[00:45:53] are you trying to accomplish you

[00:45:57] all yours you're famous for saying having a plan you you may not

[00:46:00] follow the plan but having a plan is better than no plan what are you thinking over

[00:46:04] the next five years or ten years for you well

[00:46:08] I you know I this is always this always

[00:46:11] sounds too too ambitious or too grandiose but you

[00:46:15] you know I um I would like to get

[00:46:19] our society our society to get back to the future to

[00:46:23] get back to to a society that's that's

[00:46:27] a you know progressing in in all

[00:46:30] these all these important dimensions and there's

[00:46:34] sort of a you know there's sort of a very local way of doing that which is investing

[00:46:38] in futuristic technology company so that's a small you

[00:46:42] know manageable way you do this and then there's sort of our you know broader conversations

[00:46:46] like the one we're having today where we try to we try to get people

[00:46:50] to think about this topic but it's yeah we should we we

[00:46:54] need to think about you know the future arrives it will be different from the present

[00:46:57] and if we don't think about it it's much less likely to be a good future than

[00:47:01] if we if we work to craft it peter thiel thank

[00:47:06] you for uncommon knowledge the Hoover Institution and
